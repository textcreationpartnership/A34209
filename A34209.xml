         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <head>A SERMON, Preached by Mr. ROBERT BARCLAY, At <hi>Grace-Chruch-ſtreet, May,</hi> the 16. 1688.</head>
               <p>MY Friends, This is the Teſtimony that was born of Old, and it is alſo born this Day, that there may be an Agreement betwen the Members and the Head, the Word and the Power, the Notion and the Subſtance, <hi>He that hath the Son hath Life, and he that hath not the Son hath not Life;</hi> So that in this the Subſtance is known, whereby Men are Redeemed to Live unto God, and to Live for God and to Glorifie him. This is the end of the Teſtimony of the Goſpel of our Lord and Saviour Chriſt Jeſus, that we may all come to partake of his Life, and that by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of it we may live upon it, and being made alive to him we ſhall then be made able to ſerve him, then ſhall we be enabled to Worſhip him, to Glorifie him, and to Declare of his Glory and of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:46240:4"/> his Power and of his <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> and of his Goodneſs to thoſe that are <hi>Strangers</hi> to him, and to Invite all to be Partakers thereof. Let all your Eyes this Day be towards him, and to the Injoyment of his Life, that you may be Senſible, and that you may be Witneſſes of his Life.</p>
               <p>And this Life is not to be obtained but by <hi>Death;</hi> There is a Dying before there is a Living: Every Plant, Seed or Grain that is placed in the Earth, it dies before it grows up, there is a Dying before there is a Living, Thoſe that come to the Life of the Son of God, they come to it through Death; For it was through Dying that he obtained this Life, it was neceſſary that the Son of God (the Prince of Life) ſhould die, that he ſhould be Crucified, elſe he could not finiſh the Work of our Salvation, and make way for the Revelation and the Sowing of that Seed, and the Diſpenſation of that Grace, whereby we might come to have a Share with him in that Eternal Life he obtained for us, They that come to the Life of the Son of God they muſt obey him, for they muſt receive the Sentence of Death to that Life, which they derive from <hi>Adam,</hi> that Curſed that corrupt Life of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs, that Life of Ungodlyneſs, that Life wherein Self and the Will of Man delights, wherein the Natural Man, the Animal Man hath a Life: We muſt die, and by Dying come to be Partakers of the Life of Jeſus, He Communicates himſelf to us, and by our Receiving him we Receive Life; <hi>He that hath the Son hath Life, and be that hath not the Son hath not Life,</hi> and the Conſequence is, He that hath not this Life, hath not the Son of God.</p>
               <p>This is the true way for every One to Try and Examine themſelves by, and to make a true Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:46240:4"/> of themſelves, that they may know whether they have the Son of God or not, whether they have Chriſt or not; if they have Chriſt, they have the Benefits of his Death, and of his Blood and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, they that have this Life in them, they are in the Faith, they are Partakers of Juſtification, and Sanctification, and Adoption; And all thoſe that are under the Diſpenſation of the Goſpel, that have the Benefits of Chriſts Death, to thoſe he giveth himſelf, and thoſe to whom he giveth himſelf he giveth this Life. This is not the Life of <hi>Adam,</hi> a Life of Unrighteouſneſs, but a Life that Springs from the Heavenly Incorruptible Seed, ſuch as Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of it are born again of the Word of the Lord that remains for ever, This is a Life that comes from the Lord from Heaven, the Quickning Spirit, and this Life tends Heaven-ward, it looks Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; it carries the Affections towards the things that are above, it dwells not in them that have their Pleaſures in this World; it looks not to the things of this World, it comes from <hi>Heaven and tends to Heaven again,</hi> it raiſeth the Soul that is Quickned by it. They that are born of it are made Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by it, it makes all Heavenly that are Quickned by it. <hi>By this we may know that we have the Son of God,</hi> by this we have an Underſtanding of him, and are brought into him that is true.</p>
               <p>And this is the Living Manifeſtation of Chriſt whereby he cometh into thy Soul and into my Soul. This is the Gift of God, We Receive Gods Gift, that we may receive Life from and by him, that we may Live this Life; This is that which makes the Yoke of Chriſt eaſie, and his <hi>Burden Light,</hi> and <hi>his Commandments not Grievous</hi> to us. The Life of Chriſt doth the work of Chriſt naturally; Thoſe that are in the Fleſh-mind, the things of the Fleſh,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:46240:5"/> thoſe that live a Carnal Life they mind the Works of the Fleſh, it is their Joy, their Delight and their Pleaſure, that which their Hearts are carried after. They Riſe early, and Lye down late, and all for this end, it is that which their Hearts Run after all the Day long, What is the Reaſon of it? They are in the Fleſh, in the Life of Luſt, That Life moves them, and Acts them, and Governs them, That Life uſeth and Imployeth all their Faculties, their Underſtandings, Wills, Affections and Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, and it uſeth all the Members of their Bodies to pleaſe the Fleſh, and fulfil the Luſts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; theſe are the Conſequences of a Life of Unrighteouſneſs in thoſe things that are Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous.</p>
               <p>But thoſe that have Received the Spirit of God, they have Received Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God, and this is the Conſequence, they are become Dead to the Life of Unrighteouſneſs: All that are Dead in Sins and Treſpaſſes he hath Quickned. Now when you have received the Son of God, you have received a New Life, another Life; then your Affections are ſet upon things that are above, and you are come to ſit in Heavenly places in Chriſt Jeſus, you ſit no more in the Earthly place, nor Live an earthy Life, but in the Heavenly place where the Heavenly Life abounds. <hi>For this end the Eternal Son of God came into the World that we might have Life, and that we might have it more abundantly,</hi> that we might abound in the Life of Jeſus, and in the abundance of it; This is that which is recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to us, that we might receive the Son of God into our Souls, and by receiving him, partake of his Life: and then let this Life produce its Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; <hi>Let the Word of God dwell Richly in you,</hi> in all thoſe things that are Divine, in all thoſe things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:46240:5"/> that it brings forth amongſt the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God.</p>
               <p>For it is not the things of the Earth that we are to remember, and to have dwelling in us, but the Word of God; and that which proceeds from the Life of the Son of God.

                  <p>O. <hi>Moſt Powerful Lord God of Life, and of Glory and Bleſſedneſs; pretious in thy ſight are thy People whom with thy Power thou haſt Viſited with the Day Spiring from on high, and upon whom thou haſt breathed with a Divine Inſpiration, and made them alive to thy ſelf, through thy tender Mercy and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which in the Son of thy Love thou haſt freely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to us whereby we are made capable of drawing nigh to thee, and of having acceſs into thy Bleſſed Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence to enjoy Communion with thee, through the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. We deſire to wait upon thee, and ſeek fervently after thee; All our expectation is from thee, from Day to Day, and from time to time, that we may receive Relief. that we may receive ſtrength from thee who art the God of all our Mercies. Thou haſt not been wanting to us in the needful time, thou haſt had regard to the ſighing of the Poor, to the breathing and Supplieation of the Needy, whoſe deſires have been truly after thee, and the ſweet enjoyment of thy Preſence, the feeling of thy bleſſed Power, and, the beholding of the light of thy Countenance wherein there is Life and Salvation. Bleſſed be thy Name for ever, all living praiſes and Holy Thanks givings be in truth and Humility offered up to thee, through the Dear Son of thy Love, by all thy Children and People, whom thou haſt ſought out by thy bleſſed Spirit, and whom thou haſt gathered by the Arm of thy bleſſed and mighty Power that they might be a People to thy praiſe, ſerving thee in newneſs of Spirit, Worſhipping thee, in the beauties of Holineſs, and in Spirit and truth, and not according to the old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Letter, not according to an empty and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward formality, but in the ſenſe of the Springings up of that pure Life, of that freſh Spring of Life, that thou</hi>

               </epigraph>
               <p>THis is the Word of the Lord God to all People this day, this lies not in airy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and in vain Imagination, and whatſoever elſe it is that you deck your ſelves with all, you muſt every particular Man and Woman be born again, elſe you cannot enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven. This was the Doctrine of Chriſt in that prepared body wherein he appeared in the World, and Preached to <hi>Nicodemus</hi> That ſtanding Doctrine to this moment of time, and will be ſo while any man breaths upon the Earth; there is no other way, no other gate to enter into Life by but this great work of <hi>Regeneration.</hi> Now to enforce People to come to this great Work, and to ſet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward from Earth to Heaven, all being driven out of Paradice by the Cherubim ſet with a Flaming Sword, there is no returning to that Bleſſed Life,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:46240:9"/> but by the loſs of that Life that did grieve the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, and which did cauſe Man to be driven out; there is no other way of return again but by this New Birth. As you are all driven and forced out of Paradiſe, and the Flaming Sword and the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubims are ſet to keep the way of the Tree of Life, ſo you muſt return into the favour of God again by the Light of Chriſt, and you have Line upon Line, Precept upon Precept, here a little, and there a little, to direct your minds to the Light of Chriſt Jeſus. As the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> was made a living Soul, ſo the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> is a quickning Spirit. This know for certain, no Man or Woman can be quickned and raiſed up into the life of the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> till the life of the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> be taken away from them.</p>
               <p>So now, let every one of you deal plainly with your own hearts, how you came to be a ſlain Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to the life of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> in which life there was a working of the Myſtery of Iniquity in every part of Man. One cries lo here is Chriſt, another, lo there is Chriſt, and every one is following his own imagination about the Letter of the Scripture, this is ſtill but the vain Spirit of Man running and ſtriving to recover himſelf; and this is the cauſe there is ſo much profeſſion of God, and ſo little of his Nature appearing among the Sons and Daughters of Men. Now all of you that come to be regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, you muſt come to the light of Chriſt, there is no other way to it. He will ſearch your hearts, and try your reins, and ſet your ſins in order be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, and trace out the iniquities that compaſs you about, therefore you muſt ſee your ſelves a loſt People, a ſinful People, and ſo come to feel the weight of your Sins upon your Conſciences, there is no other way to come to life; you will never
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:46240:9"/> complain of Sin till you be burthened with it, 'till you have a Trumpet ſounding in your ears, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken you that you may ariſe from the Dead, that Chriſt may give you light; there is no other way Dear People, you muſt bring your deeds to the light of Chriſt, and abide the ſentence of Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; if you ſave your lives, you loſe them; if you will loſe your lives for Chriſts ſake, there is no danger of your Eternal Life. <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt Chriſt's fore-runner declared, <hi>I indeed Baptize you with water unto Repentance, but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, the Latchet of whoſe Shooes I am not worthy to unloſe, he ſhall Baptize you with the Holy-Ghoſt, and with Fire, whoſe Fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and will gather his Wheat into his Garner, but the Chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.</hi> What is it the better for you to read the Scripture, if you know not this fiery Baptiſm which all muſt know that are regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated; deceive not your ſelves, Chriſt will <hi>appear in flaming fire, and take vengeance on all them that know not God, and that obey not the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſtand here as a Witneſs of the Lord of Life this day, there is no way for people to come to Salvation, but they muſt know Chriſt revealed in all their hearts. What is he doing but rendring Vengeance upon the carnal mind, ſelf-pleaſing, and all inordinate Affections; he comes with Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance to take away thy Life, he will Baptize thee with the Holy Ghoſt, and with Fire. If thou knoweſt not this, thou art not a true Chriſtian. Thou wilt never look Death in the face with joy, nor go down to the Grave with Triumph. If thou liveſt at home in the body, and flyeſt for thy life, and wilt not be willing to loſe thy life for Chriſt
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:46240:10"/> if thou art called to it, and if thou wilt not have Chriſt to waſh thee (ſome for ſhineſs, and ſome for ſelf-love, will refuſe this) if Chriſt doth not waſh thee, thou haſt no part in him; you muſt come to Chriſt to purifie you in the fiery furnace, <hi>the Day of the Lord ſhall burn as an Oven</hi> (as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſpeaks) this is a dreadful day, a day of Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, the day of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemeth his People from their Sins, <hi>Zion is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed with Judgment, and Eſtabliſhed with Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.</hi> Do not make the way to Heaven eaſier in your minds and imaginations than indeed it is, and think it not ſufficient to live in an outward ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of the ways of God. If your own wills be alive, and your corruptions remain unmortified, the Judgment of God will be your Portion, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the Lord's name come along with me, I am come to declare what I have heard and ſeen of the Father. Come and examine thy Conſcience, haſt thou brought thy deeds to the light? then thou haſt received Condemnation upon thy ſelf, and thy haughtineſs is bowed down, and laid low, and thou ſeeſt thy ſelf a poor miſerable wretch before the Eternal God. Whatſoever thou knoweſt of the mind of God, haſt thou reformed thy ways, come along with me, and tell me what is the ground of thy Faith? and thy conſidence? is it thy obedience and qualifications? becauſe thy obedience is right, and thy qualifications right, what uſe doſt thou make of tnem? read the Book of Conſcience haſt thou no ground for thy Faith, thou haſt put on the Reformed Faith, and liveſt an unreformed Life; ſearch and try thy ſelf, Man, or Woman. Doſt thou watch over thy ſelf, and keep in a ſenſe of thy diſſolution, notwithſtanding all thy qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and partial Reformation? Doſt thou <hi>ſtrive to</hi>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:46240:10"/> 
                  <hi>enter in at the ſtrait Gate,</hi> and the narrow way, here is the loſt Sheep, thou ſeekeſt the life of thy will, the life of the firſt <hi>Adam;</hi> the juſtice of God will not ſuffer thee to make a Saviour of thy Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Qualifications, and to take God's Jewels and to deck thy ſelf with them, thou canſt not be ſaved without the Righteouſneſs of God in Chriſt Jeſus. What ſaith thy Conſcience, art thou brought to this change of thy Mind, and of thy Converſation? Are you all willing to part with your Sins, with your Pride and Haughtineſs? Are you willing to part with your vile Affections? this is the work of Gods grace upon you, doſt thou place thy confidence in thy Duties and Qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and takeſt God's Jewels and Oraments, and deckeſt thy ſelf with them? <hi>Thou tookeſt my Jewels</hi> ſaith the <hi>Lord, and didſt play the Harlot;</hi> if thou return to the Lord, and humble thy ſelf, and get through this difficulty, thou wilt be happy for ever. This Judgment of God, this Flaming-Sword that turns every way, will keep thee from returning to Sin, and bring thee to Chriſt, and cut thee off from all hope of Salvation but by him, and make thee to ſee the abſolute need of a Saviour, and that thy <hi>Life is hid with Chriſt in God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is Gods infinite goodneſs to Men that he will hide pride from them, and humble them under his mighty hand. This is the Condition of poor Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that are ſlain by the hands of the moſt High; How may I know when I am ſlain and baptized, and come to have ſincerity? They that have this Baptiſm enter into the Heavenly Life, if you love the light of Chriſt Jeſus, it will be thus with you, God will make ſhort work in the Earth. He will ſet thy Sins in order before thee, and make thee watchful unto Prayer, and lead thee to holineſs of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:46240:11"/> Life and Converſation, and make thee abhor thy ſelf, and deſpiſe all the Pomps and Pleaſures and Vanities of the World; when he hath adorned thee with his Graces, then watch for the Light, and in the Light of Chriſt thou ſhalt ſee Light, and that all thou haſt done, and canſt do, is but thy Duty. All this thou oughteſt to do, thou art Gods Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and all this will not juſtifie thee in order to thy Eternal Salvation for theſe ſervices thou oweſt unto God. If thou diligently wait, thou ſhalt ſee more light, then the Sword that proceeds out of the mouth of Chriſt who is called the word of God, will cut thee off from all thy hopes of Salvation from any thing thou haſt done, from any of thy qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications, from any thing that thou canſt do, ſo that thou wilt be a hopeleſs Soul, nothing in thy own ſenſe and apprehenſion, the power of the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> muſt die before him, and thou wilt cry out, I am a dead, loſt, and undone Creature, but there is a Life hid with Chriſt in God for me, but I can never have it 'till I be ſlain into the will of God, and become as a little Child, and be ſtript of all my own Excellency that I have attained; I muſt come to a ſenſe of my own miſery, and fall down at the foot of God; when I am become as a little Child humbled and ſlain as to my own will and confidence in my own righteouſneſs I will not then queſtion but I ſhall live a Holy Life, but I will give all that Life I had, for that <hi>Life which is hid with Chriſt in God;</hi> O! there is none come ſo far that ever miſs of Eternal Life. All Shuffling People that would have Salvation by Chriſt, and will not let him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe his Heavenly Power, his Princely Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Power to Baptize them into his Death, it is they that come ſhort of Salvation; but all thoſe that yield themſelves up to Chriſt to be Redeemed
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:46240:11"/> through Judgment, and are become as little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, theſe are sn a happy ſtate. You know that our Lord Jeſus Chriſt took a little Child in his Arms, and ſaid whoſoever becomes not as a little Child cannot enter into the Kingdom of Heaven; you muſt all of you become as little Children, and depend upon the Mercy and Free Grace of God; you muſt all come to a Holy reſignation of your ſelves to Gods diſpoſal: If you come to Chriſt as little Children and depend upon him, you cannot miſs of Salvation; it is entailed upon ſuch Souls as hear the Voice of Chriſt, they that hear the Voice of the Son of the God ſhall live.</p>
               <p>I Stand here as a Witneſs for the God of Heaven, I never heard the Voice of Chriſt (as his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lower) till I was ſlain, and Baptized and lay as a little Child under his Heavenly Chaſtiſements; as ſoon as ever my Soul was brought to this in my Humiliation, O then the dreadful Judgment was taken aaway, and the Book of Life was opened unto me: and the Lord ſpake comfortably to me, <hi>I have lov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Now in this conformity to Chriſt's Death, People may die into Life, and Bleſſed are the dead that die in the Lord for they reſt from their Labours, and their Works do follow them. Away with all your own Wills, and your Pride, and Haughtineſs, and your Hypocriſie, and Deceit, and all depend ancy upon any qualification of your own; you muſt come to have your Life ſeperated from you elſe you will all periſh. Thoſe that will die with Chriſt, and be willing to die for him, he is revealed as a Saviour to them. He was before us in the

O! Who will not loſe their lives for this Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Life? Who will not die for this Eternal Life? Now the matter lyes in the Death of your own Wills, when you have done the will of God,

               <p>Thus it hath been with the Holieſt People on Earth; it is not by works of righteouſneſs of thy own that thou canſt be ſaved, Chriſt comes to cut all theſe down, that thou mayſt be Ingrafted into him, and juſtified by his Grace. Do not make this matter of Talk, and ſay I have heard this and that, but look into you own hearts, and ſee what Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly workings are there; What there is of the Power of the Lord Jeſus that hath made you to loath this World, and the inordinate Love of the Creature, that you may enjoy all theſe things as if you enjoyed them not, We cannot when we are ſlain and Crucified to this World but ſay my life is in Chriſt, when we come to aſcribe nothing to our ſelves, and all to Chriſt here is a bleſſed Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, broken Hearts, melted Spirits, and yet joyful Souls; poor Creatures that were mourning and ſighing, and crying before the Lord in retired places, and yet rejoycing in Chriſt Jeſus, I am riſen with Chriſt, I ſaid my hope is cut off, I will lye down in thy will O God; do what thou wilt with me, it is in thy Soveraign pleaſure and free gift,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:46240:13"/> whether thou give me life or deny it to me: There muſt be a reſignation of our ſelves to the will of God, it was ſo with the Lord Jeſus, and it is ſo with every true Saint of God, you muſt be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled as little Children before judgment be taken away, and the loving kindneſs of God ſealed up to your Souls; if you ſeek this work of God you will find it, if you ſeek it upon your Beds, in all your Labours and concernments, in all your Stations and Relations; if you preſs after the new Birth, you muſt uſe this World, as if you uſed it not and live a Married life, as if you were Un-married, for the faſhion of this of World paſſeth away. This is not Rantiſm.</p>
               <p>But let me tell you, a New World comes by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, a Man is not lifted up in his own mind, but laid low in his own Eyes, he waits for the Wiſdom of God to govern him, and he is as a Steward of the Grace of God, to give to them that ſtand in need, when a Man is regenerated and born again, he is as contented with Bread and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as with all the enjoyments of this World; what is the matter? His own will is gone, and put down under his feet, and whatſoever it is that gives life to all his vain deſires and Affections; there is a Harmony of all within, a Man praiſing of God, and bleſſing his Holy Name, there are no Intanglements ſhall draw away the Heart from ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of God, and ſeeking his Glory; and if God ſhall call the Husband from the Wife, or the Wife from the Husband, for the Glory of his Name, there is no whining and complaining, and crying out but giving them up, and a praiſing and bleſſing God when they are called to ſuch an exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, and if they are not called to that then they ſet their Hearts to glorifie God in their ſeveral places
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:46240:14"/> and ſtations, then they have a full content in a bleſſed reſignation; Here their Wills are ſlain but they praiſe God they have no deſire, but Lord thy will be done, always praiſing God, always having the fear, and the glory of God before their Eyes. All the miſchief is hatched in pleaſing mens own Wills: That is, the Counſel of every Heart that Chriſt doth not govern, Will you live as the <hi>Quakers,</hi> then you muſt live contemptibly, the Miſtriſs and Maid are Hail-fellow well met; No, every one muſt walk in humility, and live in acquaintance with the God of Heaven, ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Here is now a New World, and the faſhions of the Old World are gone, all Pride, Haughtineſs, Croſneſs, and Trampling upon one another are all gone, all ſlain, through the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>What remains now, Chriſt is in me, and we are all one in him; Chriſt laid down his Life for thee and me; Now he reigns in me, and he hath prepared my body to die for the truth, as his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared body was laid down for my Sin. It is a kind of Fooliſh Profeſſion to make Profeſſion of Chriſt and live in Covetouſneſs, Profaneneſs, Senſuality and the like; they that are come to this Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Birth ſeek the things that are above, thou canſt do no other; <hi>Make the Tree good and the Fruit will be good.</hi> You muſt be Ingrafted into the Vine of Gods righteouſneſs, O! ſlight not the Day of your Viſitation, What was it to me to read of any being born again, till I was ſlain, and knew the Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Baptiſm of Chriſt Jeſus? Till I ſaw the Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Sword ready to ſlay me in every way, in every turning. The Light of Chriſt convinced
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:46240:14"/> me of Sin, and his Righteouſneſs juſtified me, and thoſe Works were abominable to me that hindred my Souls paſſage to Chriſt; Chriſt Jeſus in Marrying my Soul to himſelf ſeized upon me, and did work effectually in me; There is the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Chriſt in me, he hath Sealed up my Soul <hi>to the Day of my Redemption,</hi> here is a certain paſſage, and a certain way which never any miſs of that loſe their Lives for Chriſt: If you be not ready and willing to loſe your Lives for Chriſt, you ſhall never come here; The Gate is ſtrait and the way is narrow, none come hither but thoſe that die into an Heavenly Oneneſs with Chriſt. O Friends let us empty our ſelves that Chriſt may fill us, let us be nothing in our own Eyes that we may be all in him, and receive of his fulneſs.</p>
               <p>Now I commend you to God's Witneſs, that you may remember what hath been ſpoken among you, but conſider, if you do not harken to it, it will follow you, and be a plague to you to all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity; if you will not yield up your ſelves to Chriſt this day that burns like an Oven, this Fire you muſt dwell with when out of the Body, there will be no quenching of this Fire for ever; but if you be ſo wiſe for your Souls as to reſign your ſelves up to Chriſt, and come to him as little Children this will not hinder your Earthly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, though the World may account thee a Fool, yet thou haſt that part of Heavenly Wiſdom to do what thou doſt as unto God; thou carrieſt to thy Wife, as in the ſight of God, that ſhe may be Sanctified to thee, and thou to her; and thou car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieſt becomingly to thy children and Servants, and thou wilt abound in Grace and in every good work which will be for thine Eternal well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare.</p>

               <p>O I beſeech you People, for the Lord's ſake wait for the light of Chriſt, to guide you, learn of him to be meek and lowly, then happy are you, for <hi>he dwelleth with the humble, but he beholdeth the Proud afar off.</hi> This New Birth which is a true work, a ſincere and heavenly work, it will make you for ever. O make room for Chriſt in your Hearts, or elſe he is never like to dwell with you, he loveth to dwell with the poor and humble and contrite Spirit, he abhors the Proud, he will empty your Souls that he may fill them.</p>
               <p>And ſo I commend you to God, I have been long held in durance under great weakneſs; and I was reſtleſs till I could come up to this Great City of <hi>London,</hi> to Preach the Everlaſting Goſpel among you, and you ſee I am among you here, pray every one of you turn Inward; let not theſe Words paſſing through a mean Veſſel be as a bare empty Diſcourſe of Truth to you, which you only hear, and take no further care of your Salvation. Take heed of deſpiſing the light that ſhines in the midſt of you, and be preſſing forward to the Heavenly work that is laid in the Power of Chriſt Jeſus even through Judgment into Death, and then he will give Eternal Life; the Lord confirm this that it may reſt upon your Hearts that you may be dead to the things of World: <hi>We are not come to Mount Sinai that gen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THE Great God who made Heaven and Earth, the God of our <hi>Salvation,</hi> he hath prepared a Sacrifice for himſelf in the hearts of a Remuant whom he hath gathered by the Arm of his Mighty Power, and he hath kindled that Sacrifice that is of his own preparing, and this to a Remnant is a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt Token of the Love of God, and of his Divine and ſpecial Providence for their ſafety and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation that truſt in him, and that are ſincerely devoted to his ſervice and fear, and that walk in humility before him; and this, my Friends, is mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of weighty and tender concernment upon my Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, to mind all of you that come to our Meetings, and hear the Truth declared from time to time, that you ſeriouſly conſider the great work that the Lord is about to bring to paſs, that every one ſhould wait for, that they may feel his Mighty Power preparing their hearts for himſelf, and raiſing up Breathings and Supplications to him that is a God hearing Prayers that are offered in uprightneſs and ſincerity

               <p>Theſe things have been foretold, for the encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement and for the ſtrengthning of the Faith of thoſe whoſe Faces are Sion-ward, whoſe eyes are turned towards the Lord their Maker, who have taſted in ſome meaſure of the Power and of the Goodneſs of the Lord our God, that they may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in the Faith, whereby their hearts may be drawn after the Lord, that thoſe who have been made partakers of the true and living Faith of the

               <p>Therefore, dear Friends, be ye concerned, and be inward with the Lord, and attend upon him without diſtraction, that nothing may hurry, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſe, nor diſtract your minds, or turn them about from the Faith, truſt and Confidence you have in the Lord which he hath gathered his People into, that every one may be exerciſed in a Watchful ſtate, and in Lowlyneſs and Humility, and look unto, and depend upon the Lord for ſtrength for help, and Power to enable us to ſtand againſt all the Wiles of Satan, that none may be led into any extream from the ſenſe of Truth, and from a feeling of that Power that doth prepare

               </p>
               <p>So my Friends, and Friendly People let your Faith ſtand in that Power that hath gathered you, in that Arm of the Lord that he hath made bare, and ſtretched forth to bring a People to himſelf; that every one may live by Faith, and have their dependance upon the Lord for ſtrength and for relief, that they may partake of the immediate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of his Spirit, which he he is ready to Miniſter and Communicate to thoſe that are given up to ſerve the Lord, that your Prayers and Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations may be in the Spirit to that God that pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out a <hi>Spirit of Grace and Supplication upon his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> and he is daily pouring out his Holy Spirit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his People, that their Prayers and ſupplications may reach to him, who is a <hi>God hearing Prayers;</hi> That they may be prevalent with God for the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of themſelves and others, and for the good of all Nations, that they may awaken many to repent, and <hi>ſeek the Lord, whil he may be found and call upon him while he is near,</hi> that they may be turned from the evil of their ways, and from the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:46240:18"/> many Provocations whereby the Inhabitants of the Earth have greatly incurred the Diſpleaſure of God, and that they may be ſenſible how ready the Lord is to turn away his wrath from them.</p>
               <p>This is the deſire of the Hearts and Souls of a Remnant, on the behalf of many whom the Lord will yet viſit and reach unto and call out of the dark ways and by Paths of Sin and Corruption, that they may be brought into a Capacity to know the way of Truth, and Righteouſneſs and Peace. And my Friends, while People are ſenſible that there are true breathings and deſires after God, and that there is a particular Travel of Soul for the good of a Nation, and for the converting of Sinners from the Evil of their ways, this is a ſign that God is waiting to be gracious; He may viſit a People and Nation with Chaſtiſements and Judgments, yet I am ſenſible it is for his Peoples ſake, even a Remnant that he hath gathered out of the empty Profeſſions, and Forms that are in the World that the Lord is ſtill waiting to be Gracious and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending his Patience and Long-ſuffering, that he may convince them, humble them, and overcome them with his Love, and when he corrects and puniſheth, yet he hath Reſerves of Mercy, for them if they will repent and turn from Sin, and humble themſelves under the mighty hands of God, that he may in due time exalt them, and bring them from under the weight of their Iniquities, and the guilt of their tranſgreſſions that they may receive mercy for his Name's ſake, and for his dear Son's ſake.</p>
               <p>This is the Breathing, and the Travel of the Souls of a Remnant, and we may truly ſay, the Lord hath left a Seed, a ſmall Remnant that look to him and truſt in him, though a People and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:46240:19"/> have ſinned againſt the Lord, who otherwiſe had been as <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gommorrah;</hi> if God had not left us a Seed, yet for the ſake of a little Seed, even for the ſake of the Worm <hi>Jacob</hi> that wreſtled with him by Prayer and Supplication, the Lord hath ſpared many, and waited to be Gracious to them; they are truly a People that are a Praying People that have the Advantage of all others; yet I do not condemn all forms of Profeſſion, there are ſome that have a ſecret ſincerity, and a fear of God, and a deſire after the Lord, that are as Sheep ſcattered upon the barren Mountains, that yet the Lord will gather; there are thoſe that have a ſecret longing and thirſting after the living God, that deſire to know the things that belong to their Peace; <hi>There are other Sheep of Chriſt which are not of this Fold, them alſo will he bring home,</hi> that they may know where the Green Paſtures are, and be led by the ſtill waters, and find relief and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the Lord.</p>
               <p>Therefore all thoſe that the Lord hath gathered, and preſerved and kept to this moment, and helped them, and ſupplied them, and continued his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to them ſhould be thankful, and ſenſible of his loving kindneſs, that by an Inviſible Power hath given them comfort and refreſhment while they have been waiting on him; let their minds and hearts be ſtill fixed upon the Lord, and ſtaid on him, and he will preſerve them in quientneſs and peace, and they ſhall know he will <hi>ſhew</hi> his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence with them, that their Bread may be ſure, and their Waters may not fail, the Lord will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them to the end of their Days, in humility and lowlyneſs, wherein they may be capable of Inſtruction; and by his Holy Spirit he will lead them in the way they ſhould walk, thoſe that come
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:46240:19"/> unto the Lord with weeping and ſupplication the Lord he will lead them by the Rivers of Water in a plain way, where they ſhall not ſtumble. The Lord our God hath prepared a Sacrifice, and he will accept that Sacrifice which is of his own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring, and this (I ſay) to a Remnant is a manifeſt token of his Love.</p>
               <p>God Almighty Preſerve you, and bleſs the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of his Servants among you, who labour in the Word and Doctrine, and in the Goſpel of your Salvation whilſt they are among you, that you may know the Goodneſs of the Lord that waiteth to be gracious, and have renewed experiences of his Love, and obſerve for your encouragement the tender care he is pleaſed to manifeſt towards his Heritage both in this and other places; We have great cauſe humbly to be thankful to our God for what favours we enjoy, and to be diligent to make the beſt Improvement we can of all the Seaſons of Grace, and opportunities for Working out our own Salvation which the Lord is pleaſed in his abundant mercy to afford unto us.</p>

               <head>A SERMON, Preached by Mr. FRANCIS CAMFIELD, <hi>At Grace-Church ſtreet, May,</hi> the 14. 1693.</head>
               <p>MY Friends, You have often heard by the Servants of the Lord that have given Teſtimony to Jeſus, the only and alone Saviour, you have often heard the Report, and the Report is true, That <hi>there is no Name under Heaven by which any man can be ſaved, but the Name of Jeſus;</hi> And you have oftentimes read alſo in the Holy Scripture of this Jeſus the only and alone Saviour, all the Holy Prophets gave Teſtimony that he ſhould come and when he was come all the Holy Apoſtles and Miniſters of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt they gave Teſtimony that he was come, and they were made able Miniſters of the New Teſtament, and their great buſineſs was (as Inſtruments in the hands of the Great God) <hi>to turn men from Darkneſs to Light,</hi>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:46240:22"/> 
                  <hi>and from the Power of Satan to the Power of God, that they might receive forgiveneſs of ſins and an Inheritance among them that are Sanctified;</hi> you know the Scripture ſpeaks plentifully after this manner. I hope there are none here but have believed the Teſtimonies that have been given, but the great thing is for every one to come to a Conſideration of this; Since you have believed the Report, that which is every ones concern now, is to examine themſelves whether or no they are really turned from Darkneſs to the Heavenly Light; None come to be turned from Darkneſs to Light, but they come to know <hi>Repentance from Dead Works, and Faith towards our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And as every one comes to know this, they come to know what it is to lay a good Foundation; This was the Foundation the Primitive Chriſtians laid, as you may Remember the Exhortation of the Apoſtle, in the Sixth Chapter of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews, Therefore leaving the Principles of the Doctrine of Chriſt, let us go on unto Perfection not laying again the Foundation of Repentance from dead Works, and of Faith towards God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus you ſee he preſſeth them to go on to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, that is the buſineſs of every one of you that believe in the Name of Jeſus that you keep walking on in the Holy way, We that are come to know this Holy way through the Riches of the Love and Grace of the Great God to us, it is our main buſineſs to walk in this Holy way, they that know any thing of true Chriſtianity know this to be their great concern, to walk in this Holy way that leads to Everlaſting Life; Chriſt is <hi>the Way, the Truth, and the Life;</hi> and every one that comes into this way, and walketh in it, they are going on towards Perfection. And they are
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:46240:23"/> putting off the Old Man; They feel in themſelves a Power at work that Crucifies <hi>the Old man with his Deeds,</hi> then they go on in the Name of the Lord. This Power doth work till every one in their own particular comes to be Crucified with Chriſt; It was the Primitive Chriſtians experience, what the Apoſtle ſaith of himſelf, 2 Gal. 20. <hi>I am Crucified with Chriſt neverthleſs I live, yet not I but Chriſt liveth in me, and the life which I now live in the fleſh, I live by the Faith of the Son of God, who loved me and gave himſelf for me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Great is the Myſtery of Godlineſs,</hi> You that are engaged in the Chriſtian Warfare, and that live the Chriſtian Life, and are making War in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs againſt the Devil the Enemy of your Souls, you know that <hi>Great is this Myſtery of Godlineſs,</hi> this Myſtery is opened among the Diſciples of Jeſus among the Holy Off-ſpring of God, <hi>who are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten again through the Word of Eternal Life;</hi> who as the Holy Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>are begotten of his own Will through the Word of Truth, that they ſhould be a kind of Firſt fruits of his Creatures;</hi> We to whom God hath Graciouſly manifeſted himſelf in the Bleſſed Son of his Love, our Lord and Saviour Chriſt Jeſus, how ought we to walk as becomes the Goſpel, O that the ſerious and weighty Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of this, might reſt upon every one of us, that we ought to have our Converſation as becomes the Goſpel of Chriſt, and be going on to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; you know what the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 3. Phil. 12. <hi>Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect, but I follow after, if that I may apprechend that for which alſo I am apprehended of Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> This I am ſure every true Chriſtian Man and Woman will do, as the ſame Apoſtle did; who ſaith, <hi>I preſs towards the mark for the Price of the</hi>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:46240:23"/> 
                  <hi>high calling of God in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> And as every one comes to grow up in the Life of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, they will come to know an increaſe of Faith, they will grow up in Faith, and in that Hope which hath been as an Anchor to their Souls, in the day of their deep Exerciſe, and they will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main ſteadfaſt and unmoveable, as they walk in the holy way; And ſo every one as they keep humble and bowed before the God Heaven, they will know his Teachings more and more, and have a ſenſible feeling of it in themſelves, every one in their own particular.</p>
               <p>And certainly, it is all our buſineſs to be waiting for the fulfilling of thoſe many great and precious promiſes, which are recorded in the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which were enjoyed by the Primitive Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in the Ages that are paſt and gone, and in ſucceeding times ſhall be likewiſe enjoyed by all true Chriſtian People as they come to be Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Jeſus; as we have begun well, let us go on towards Perfection, <hi>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t laying again</hi> (as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) <hi>the Foundation of Repentame from dead Works, and Faith towards God and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> for who ever expects Salvation by Chriſt the only Saviour, muſt be going on to Perfection, they muſt begin at the work of Regeneration, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in themſelves a New Birth, for if we <hi>be not born again, we ſhall die in our Sins;</hi> you know our Saviour hath left this upon Record, and it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains the ſame truth to this day.</p>
               <p>And therefore how ought every one that makes mention of the name of Great God, and of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, How ought every ſuch a one to be weighty and conſiderate, and Examine themſelves whether they are come to know Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance from Dead Works, Whether they have
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:46240:24"/> turned from the evil of their doings; Some are ready to ſay I would gladly turn from the evil of my doings, but I find I am beſet with the Devil, the Enemy of my Soul; Well if thou believeſt in the Light wherewith Chriſt Jeſus hath enlightened thee, then Cry to him, and he will give thee Power to withſtand the Enemy of thy Soul.</p>
               <p>Praiſed and Bleſſed be the Name of our God, that a Remnant can ſay as ſoon as we did really Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in the Name of Jeſus, we received power in ſome meaſure as the Primitive Believers did that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Chriſt, we received Power to become the Sons of God; you that have received this Power, let your Eye be to the Lord, and cry to him, for Divine Aſſiſtance; for of our ſelves we are not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, we have not power of our ſelves to think a good thought or do a good Action, but we depend upon the Power of God to enable us to <hi>Work out our own Salvation; For it is God that worketh in us both to will and to do of his own good pleaſure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore Repentance, and Remiſſion of Sins are Preached in Chriſts Name, and without the Knowledge, and Chriſtian experience of this, and believing in the Name of Jeſus, we cannot be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the wrath to come; Let us wait upon God who by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſaveth all his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from their Sins; <hi>Not by Works of Righteouſneſs that we have done, but</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſaith,) <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Mercy he ſaved us, by the waſhing of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, and renewing of the Holy Ghoſt, which he ſhed on us abundantly through Jeſus Chriſt our Saviour.</hi> Thoſe that have experience of the work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, and of being renewed in their Inward parts where Chriſt bears Rule, when they meet together in the Solemn Aſſemblies of the Lords People, he will be in the midſt of them, and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:46240:24"/> they that come to hear the word of the Lord, and wait upon him, know it to be ſo; you that are real Chriſtian People, you know this by your own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, therefore wait upon the Lord your God, that the work of Regeneration may go on, and you will find ſtrength more and more miniſtred to you, and you will feel the pouring forth of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit abundantly upon you, the ſame Spirit that raiſed up our Lord Jeſus from the dead, and quickned him, ſhall quicken you, that you may live to him here, and with him for ever hereafter.</p>

Many Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple make a profeſſion of belief in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, but do not come to know this mighty power to work Sanctification, Redemption, and Salvation. Let all and every one of you be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in waiting upon God, and attending upon him, that you may receive ſtrength and power and ability from him, whereby you may be enabled to perform your bounden duty, which God requireth of you, <hi>he hath ſhewn unto Man what is good, and what the Lord requires of him, which is to do juſtly,</hi>

               <p>It is a bleſſed to be found in that which gives ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceptance with God; now there is no acceptance with God, but as we are found in Chriſt Jeſus, in him that was the promiſed Seed, whom God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed ſhould break the Serpents head; the Serpent beguiled <hi>Eve</hi> through ſubtilty; Now God promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that <hi>the Seed of the Woman, that is Chriſt Jeſus ſhould break the Serpents head;</hi> It is through him that Redemption and Salvation is known; It is through Chriſt Jeſus the Mediator between God and Man, that Man becomes reconciled to God, and no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. <hi>He taſted Death for every man, and he died that he might deſtroy him that had the Power of Death, that is the Devil.</hi> It is through Chriſt the Mediator that we are reconciled to God, <hi>and for this</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>was the Son of God manifeſted, that he might deſtroy the works of the Devil.</hi> Sin in all Ages hath been the work of the Devil, and the Devil is the Author of Sin, but the Lord Jeſus Chriſt the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, <hi>he is the Author of Eternal Salvation to all them that obey him.</hi> So that whatſoever your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion may be of God or of Chriſt, <hi>his Servants ye are, to whom you obey;</hi> Now conſider whoſe Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants you are, whether you are Servants of ſin, or bought by Chriſt Jeſus, and Redeemed from an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly life, and from a vain Converſation.

               <p>Friends, I teſtifie among you at this time, there is not a living deſire in the Soul to that which is good, but Chriſt is <hi>the Author of it, he is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of Eternal Salvation to as many as obey him.</hi> It is he that begun the work, he met with us by his Power and Spirit when we were ſtrangers to God. For we, as well as others, were in the broad way going hand in hand with a multitude to do evil, and we did not ſeek God, till he did firſt ſeek us, we did not deſire the knowledge of his ways till he raiſed deſires in our Souls, he met with us in the way of his Judgments, cauſing terrour to take hold of Tranſgreſſors, ſo that we could not take delight in vanities and pleaſures as we had done, becauſe his terrours took hold of us, bleſſed be the name of the Lord.

Bleſſed be the name of the Lord that did ſeek us out, that met with us, that put a ſtop to us in our way that we could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in vanity as we had done. The Lord brought us to a conſideration of our ways and doings; He mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted to us, if <hi>I</hi> live and die in this way <hi>I</hi> am in, <hi>I</hi> am undone for ever, <hi>I</hi> am miſerable for ever, if <hi>I</hi> do not know Redemption and Salvation by Jeſus
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:46240:28"/> Chriſt. The Lord manifeſted to us by the ſhining of his Divine Light in our hearts, that we were in the Broad way that leads to deſtruction, we read of the Narrow way that leads to Life, and of the Broad way that leads to deſtruction. We read of the narrow way, but we did not know our ſelves to be in that way; when we ſaw the Broad way that leads to Deſtruction, this begat a breathing in our Souls, and an earneſt deſire that we might know the way that is pleaſing to him.</p>
               <p>And there being many Opinions in the World, many of us were hurried in our Minds, and where we ſaw any thing of ſobriety and weightneſs of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, we were willing to try them all, that we might know the mind of God. Friends, God raiſed a travel in our Souls, and appeared farther to us; <hi>God that Commanded the Light to ſhine out of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſhined into our hearts,</hi> whereby a diſcovery was made of that which is good, and of that which is evil. This the Lord diſcovered to us by the ſhining of his Divine light and grace in our inward parts, ſo that we need not look abroad, we reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red inward, we ſaw that we had buſineſs enough at home, we ſaw that when we had grieved the good Spirit of God we had trouble for it, and when we anſwered the breathings of the Spirit we had peace within us; ſo that we muſt diſtinguiſh between that which gave acceptance with God, and that whereby the Spirit of God was grieved from day to day.</p>
               <p>Now, my Friends, we came under a travel, God by his light and grace diſcovered to us his way, ſo that now we are come to a certainty of the way; Chriſt is the way to God, and <hi>if any man be in Chriſt; he is a New Creature, he is born again, born of the Spirit,</hi> you ſhould all of you be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:46240:28"/> and conſider what you know of a change wrought in you by the power of God, whether you have received vertue from Jeſus to ſtop the bloody iſſue of Sin. It is an eaſie thing to make a profeſſion, and to call your ſelves Chriſtians, but it is a weighty thing to be a Chriſtian, to be ſo in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allity, united unto God through Jeſus Chriſt; to be a Chriſtian is to be a follower of Chriſt; in the way of Regeneration and ſelf-denial, <hi>except a Man be Regenerate and born again he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.</hi> There are many People would go to God's Kingdom when they die, but do not mind being prepared for it, many have been pleading for Sin in their life, but would go to God's Kingdom when they die, where muſt Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple be cleanſed from ſin but on this ſide the grave? there is no Repentance in the Grave, nor no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption out of Hell. This is the day of your Viſitation, God hath prepared means whereby we may be accepted of him, conſider of it, the gate ſtands open that leads to the Holy City, there is none can enter into God's Kingdom in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilements, their hearts muſt be purged, their minds purified, they muſt know the work of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, if they will enter into God's King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Now the preparation of the heart, and the anſwer of the Tongue is from Lord.</p>
               <p>I do not queſtion but here are many tender hearted ones that have tender deſires and breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Soul after God, that deſire to know peace with God, and reconciliation with their Maker. Now, my Friends, there is not another Mediator beſides Jeſus Chriſt, he is the alone Mediator and Redeemer, it is he gave himſelf a Ranſom for us, it is he that reconciles Man to God, and we muſt be found in him if we will come to have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:46240:29"/> with God; So let every one of you conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with your ſelves how far you are broken off from your evil ways, <hi>we are all by Nature Children of wrath,</hi> conſider how far you are broken off from the Wild Olive-Tree, from that which is corrupt by Nature, and whether you be grafted into Chriſt; If thou beeſt graſted into him, thou recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt ſtrength and nouriſhment and ability from him, and for this end we have waited after we have believed, we have waited for power; many a time we have travelled many Miles to a ſilent Meeting, People have wondred what encouragement we could have to travel to a ſilent Meeting, indeed we have had great encouragement to meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and we have travelled in great hazard and jeopardy, yet we have met together and the Lord hath made us living Witneſſes of the fulfilling of that promiſe <hi>that where two or three are gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in my Name I will be in the midſt of them,</hi> this was that which beautified our Meetings, and we were willing to wait, there was a diſpoſition of Soul in us, that if the Lord did hide his face from us we were troubled, if we did not enjoy the Lord, and find him in the midſt of us, it brought a great concernment upon our Minds and Spirits, and we were willing to reflect upon our ſelves, and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine within our ſelves what was the matter that the Fountain did not ſend forth its living ſtreams as at other times, and what the reaſon was it was with-held from us?</p>
               <p>Friends, this was a great exerciſe upon our Minds, but the Lord graciouſly manifeſting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf appeared to us, cauſing the Cloud many times to vaniſh away and the light of his Countenance ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned on us, and our Spirits were revived, and we were comforted, and this was a great encourrge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:46240:29"/> to us to wait upon God, ſeeing our own weakneſs to perform that which is our bounden duty which God required of us, of neceſſity this brought a conſtraint upon us to wait upon the Lord that we might renew our ſtrength, ſeeing our own weakneſs, inſufficiency and infirmity, there was a neceſſity that conſtrained us to wait for a Saviour, for a Redeemer, <hi>Iſa. 40. 31.

Wait that you may know that arm of Power that wrought ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs in you, and did beget deſires in your Souls

               <p>Now you that make a profeſſion of the truth, ſee how far you are grown into the Life of it, ſee how far it hath prevailed ſo as to ſeaſon your Souls and to make you ſavoury to God, that you may not only ſtand in a profeſſion and be Profeſſors of Life, but Poſſeſſors of Life, of the Life of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> that you may receive life and ability from him e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day, ſo as to be enabled by his power to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form what he requires of you; Now there is no more required of us but faithfulneſs according to the ability of grace given, the Lord God hath been free in his Love, and hath communicated to us a Tallent or Tallents. Now it is thoſe that are faithful in a little that he will commit more unto, but do not expect a greater Tallent, or more to be communicated, till you have been faithful in a little, which hath already been faithful in a little, which hath already been made manifeſt to you; ſee that you be every one concerned for your ſelves, mind your Travel, <hi>Lay aſide every weight and burthen, and the Sin which doth ſo eaſily beſet you, and run with patience the Race that is ſet before you, looking unto Jeſus who is the Author and</hi>

               <p>Friends I would have you to prize the Mercy of God, and the day of his Viſitation, he hath ſtretched forth his hand, and his Love and Mercy have been extended to us; There are many good People, zealous People that have deſired to ſee the Days that we now ſee, and have not lived to ſee them, but have died in the Faith of this, that God would ſend forth more of his Light, more of his Grace to the Children of Men, and that the light of the Moon ſhould be as the light of the Sun, and the light of the Sun as the light of Seaven days; many good People that are gone to their Reſt have died in the Faith of it, though they never

               <p>Take heed leaſt the myſtery of Inquity work in your minds and Spirits, work to a fleſhly liberty, to liberty to Sin! The Spirit of God works liberty and freedom from Sin, and from the bondage of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:46240:35"/> not to give way to it; <hi>If Chriſt hath made you free, then ye ſhall be free indeed, where the Spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty,</hi> a freedom from Sin; The Luſt of the fleſh, the Luſt of the Eyes, and the Pride of Life they are not of the Father, but of the World; many People Indulge the Luſts of their own mind, and embrace Pride, Vanity and Arrogance, thoſe things that are Evil, and ſo cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt themſelves, and go out of the way of God reaching after the pleaſures of the World and the Luſts of it, Here People go aſtray; but by keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Spirit, when a Temptation com es to us to gratifie our fleſh, the Spirit of the Lord lifts up a Standard againſt it; we have tryed our ſelves and our own Spirits, and in our own ſtrength we could never get forward in the ways of God; we have been convinced of it, that tho' our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings have been clear to know the way of Truth, Yet by our own ſtriving we can never get forward, by ſtriving in our own Wills.</p>
               <p>Take heed that in your ſtriving you do not ſet up ſelf, but humble your ſelves to the Duſt, and ſit at the Feet of Jeſus, learn of him to be meek and lowly, He that is the chief among you let him be the Servant of all, do not ſtrive for high places, and for Honor and Dignity, and to be accounted of among Men; If we may have the favour of God we ſhould be content to dwell in a low place, to be a Door keeper in the Houſe of God, we ſhall think it ſufficient; I doubt not (will a Gracious Soul ſay) but God hath a ſufficiency in ſtore for me, when ſo ever he calls me out of the World; Chriſt Jeſus my Lord is gone before to prepare a place for me, and he hath alſo promiſed, <hi>I will come again and receive you to my ſelf, and where I am there ſhall my Servants be.</hi> If Chriſt be gone to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare

               <p>Seek Peace with the Lord, ſeek Reconciliation with God in the right way, there are two ways, the way that leads to Life, and the way that leads to Deſtruction; the Narrow Way, and the Broad Way; be you in that way which God hath caſt up, if you are in Chriſt he is the way, the Truth and the Life; if you are in Chriſt, you are New Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, conſider what you know of a Change, of Dying unto Sin, and living unto Righteouſneſs: <hi>Put off the Old man with his Deeds, and put on the New man, which after God is Created in Righteouſneſs and true Holineſs.</hi> Conſider, how it is with you, whether you live in Sin, or in Holineſs, and Righteouſneſs; All Sin is of the Devil, He is the Author of Sin; <hi>What fruit had ye in thoſe things whereof ye are now aſhamed, for the end of thoſe things is Death, ye were the Servants of Sin, but being made free from Sin, ye became the Servants of Righteouſneſs, and now being made free from Sin, and become Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to God, ye have your fruit unto Holineſs, and the end Everlaſting Life.</hi> Here is a good change from being Servants of Sin, to be made free from Sin, through the Mediatour Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
               <p>Conſider of it, I do not deſign to enlarge, you have had Teſtimonies upon Teſtimonies, you have been put in mind of theſe things; you that make a profeſſion of the truth, there is a neceſſity and a conſtraint upon me to Remind you of former things, of things that you have been told of and been ſtirred up by the Servants of the Lord to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, I ſee a neceſſity of reminding you of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:46240:36"/> them; there are many that are in a Profeſſion of the truth, that do not dwell in the life of it, they are ſunk down into the form of Godlineſs, but they do not mind the power of it, they do part of the Work, they do not go through with it, they are for ſparing ſome Sins, that they will not mortifie them; they are like <hi>Saul,</hi> they make profeſſion of doing the Will of God, <hi>Saul</hi> ſaid to <hi>Samuel, bleſſed be thou of the Lord, I have performed the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lord,</hi> 1 Sam. 15. 14. <hi>And Samuel ſaid what meaneth then this bleating of the Sheep in mine Ears, and the Lowing of the Oxen which I hear; And Saul ſaid they have brought them from the Amalekites, for the People ſpared the beſt of the Sheep and of the Oxen, to Sacrifice unto the Lord thy God, and the reſt we have deſtroyed</hi>

               <p>Now my Friends, there are many People which are willing to give themſelves up to an outward Profeſſion of Religion, they would not be found in Prophaneſs in that which is an Abomination in the ſight of God, they would not be found in Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable Pride in the view of Gods People, they will not be ſeen in that which is Abominable, and ſhameful Wickedneſs, they will keep up a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the truth that they may be without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke; Though they are not ſo vain as to be for the faſhions of the World, yet they are of the ſame Nature and Spirit with the Men of the World, and they conform themſelves too much to the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Cuſtom, and Faſhion of the World, tho they will not be ſeen in the height of it.</p>
               <p>There are many other things might be menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, in ſhort, I would only mention this, whether you have not kept a ſecret reſerve of ſome Sins and make a fair pretence for the uſe of them, this will be a ſting to you, <hi>He that loveth any thing mor

Now that we may do this effectually God <hi>hath laid help upon one that is mighty;</hi> There are many Weakneſſes and Infirmities do attend us poor Crearures, that many times we are ready to faint; Have an Eye to Chriſt, let us look unto Jeſus, God hath <hi>laid help upon him who is mighty, and who is able to ſave to the utermoſt,</hi> not only from that which is vile and Contemptible, but he is a compleat Saviour, that will ſave to the uttermoſt, all that come unto God by him; There is no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God, or being reconciled to God but by him, and all that come to God by him ſhall have compleat Redemption for their Immortal Souls; <hi>He is the Author of Eternal Salvation to all them that obey him, He is the Author and finiſher of our Faith;</hi> He that believeth in Chriſt will ſubmit to him, and ſay in ſincerity Thy will be done; It is an ordinary thing for People to ſay, <hi>Thy Kingdom come, and thy Will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven.</hi> This is a good Prayer that Chriſt taught his Diſciples, There are many People that are often ſaying over theſe words, but they do not give up and reſign their own Wills to the Will of God, if any tryal Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction or Exerciſe befal them, they are very apt to fret and repine; If God ſhall take away a near and dear Friend, or a Wife or a Child, we muſt

               <p>TIMES and Seaſons paſs away, but <hi>the Word of the Lord endureth for ever,</hi> And it is that which hath been the Root of Life to the Heritage of God in all Ages and Generations, that from whence their Joy and Hope always ſprung, that in which their Faith was finiſhed; It was their <hi>Alpha,</hi> and it was their <hi>Omega.</hi> In this the Righteous begun and ſet forth, and by this they were preſerved in their Heavenly Race, till they came to their great end, <hi>the prize of their High Calling,</hi> the Heaven of Everlaſting Reſt, after all the Storms and Tempeſts of time; It was this they had their Eye to in the beginning, and it was their Joy that opened in the Eternal Word, by which they were Quickned and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:46240:40"/> and that cauſed them to endure to the end without fainting, and you ſhall <hi>likewiſe by patient continuance in well doing in due time Reap if you faint not.</hi> It was the Word of God to the Children of God of Old, and it is his Word in this Day to us <hi>you ſhall Reap if you faint not.</hi> Bleſſed are you that are called into the Vineyard you ſhall have an Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Harveſt, If you faint not now, you ſhall Reap then, What ſhall you Reap? Vanity and Vexation of Spirit and diſappointment. No, you <hi>ſhall Reap Glory Honor, Immortality, and Eternal Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So Friends though every Day we have Renewed occaſions of remembring our latter end, yet there is that which never ſhall have end hath dawned unto us, which hath been preſented to our View in this glorious day of our Viſitation; if we lift up our Eyes to it, and have regard to it in our riſing up and lying down, in our going out and coming in, and in all we put our hands unto, and if we place our Intereſts and Portion therein, then our minds will be eſtabliſhed, and we ſhall not be aſhamed now, nor bluſh before the Lord hereafter. <hi>If our Hearts condemn us not,</hi> we ſhall have boldneſs before God.</p>
               <p>So ſhall all Travellers that have regard to the Word of Truth while they are in their Heavenly Pilgrimage; They ſet their Faces <hi>Sion</hi> ward, and go on not Fainting, not Doubting, not deſponding, they have an Eye to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and have their Hearts kept by that Word that abides for ever; Their Belief and Hope is beyond Time, fixed upon that which God hath owned to be his Word before the World was, and ſhall be when Time and this World ſhall be no more; The outward Garment which ſhall be worn while it
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:46240:40"/> laſt, ſhall then be put off; Bleſſed are they that know the White Linnen, that which is whole and all of a piece, that God giveth to his Children that <hi>Love the Lord Jeſus in Sincerity who is the Reſurrection and the Life;</hi> He that comes to know and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence this, <hi>The Second D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Now this change is not only in the Outward Man but in the Inner Man, there is a putting off that which is Fading, Mortal and periſhing, and a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Clothed upon with Immortality, and Glory Bleſſed are they which come to receive that Word of God, which hath been the Life of God in our Souls, This is a Day of Life to us; Bleſſed are they that ſhall be placed in that Eternal Kingdom, and Region where all Time ſhall be ſwallowed up, and <hi>all Tears wiped from their Eyes and ſighing, and ſorrow ſhall be no more; O Friends lift up your Heads for the Day of your Redemption draws nigh;</hi> That you may not be ſhaken with every Wind of Doctrine, know <hi>that the Foundation of God ſtandeth ſure,</hi> that is his <hi>Word that was in the beginning with God, that Word that was God,</hi> in this Eternal Word which is God, know you dwelling and Habitation, and wait upon God in it; it was <hi>Davids</hi> Buckler, his Shield and ſtrong Tower, it was his Rock, God ſet his Feet uyon a Rock that is higher than Man's Power, and all Mans Wiſdom and Strength; In this the Righteous begin, in this they Travel on; Bleſſed are they that walk by Faith, that Live to the Lord, and Dye in the Lord, and <hi>ſhall be for ever with the Lord.</hi> They are bleſſed that wait upon the Lord for a ſenſe of this, They are above all the Changes of time and Mortality.</p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:46240:41"/>
               <p>It is this that was a Reviving Cordial to our Deceaſed Friend, who received the Truth in early Days, the Days of the Dawning of Gods Power in this Land, and in this City, the Remembrance of it was ſweet to her Soul; let us Remember the Love of God, and the Power and Glory of the Name of the Everlaſting God that ſhined then, that we may be encouraged to keep together as a <hi>peculiar People to the praiſe of him that hath called us out of Darkneſs into his Marvellous Light;</hi> That God over all may be Glorified for ever, that we may live to the Honour of his bleſſed Name; That Chriſts Kingdom may be ſet up among us, and that Gods great Name and Power, and Majeſty may be exalted, and all fleſh abaſed before him.</p>
               <p>We are Travellers here in this Vale of Tears, in this Earthly Pilgrimage into the Land of Reſt the Heavenly <hi>Canaan;</hi> Let us follow our Bleſſed <hi>Joſhua</hi> that is leading us into that Land of Promiſe, and he will give to every one his Lot, and they ſhall ſtand in that Lot at the laſt day; O Bleſſed are they that are waiting for their Lot and Portion in that Heavenly Countrey to which <hi>Abraham</hi> had his Eye, that City <hi>the New Jeruſalem the Mother of us all, and that Houſe not made with hands Eternal in the Heavens whoſe Builder and Maker is God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Word which I have been ſpeaking of is that by which we are humbled and bowed before the Lord and Inſtructed in Judgment and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; To this Word which is God, I Commit and Commend you and all the Flock of God, that you may be preſerved to the end of your Days, that you may then lay down your Heads in Peace, that your Teſtimony may not end before your Lives end, that the Lord may be with us to ſhelter and

That which is pleaſing to God is walking by Faith, What is this Faith? A pure reſolution of Living to God, in a Holy dependance on him, and a committing our ſelves intirely to him, that ſo we may know and enjoy the purifying Vertue of his Word, that we may not offend God, for without Faith faith the Apoſtle, <hi>it is impoſſible to pleaſe him; By what means</hi> (ſaith the Royal Pſalmiſt) <hi>ſhall a young man cleanſe his Way? by taking heed thereto according to thy Word,</hi> This is the Bleſſed Word that hath been a Root of Life in all Ages, let us abide in this Word to the end of our days, and we ſhall then be bleſſed with that Life which ſhall never end, but ſhall remain when time ſhall be no more.</p>
               <p>The Lord preſerve you by his Mighty power in his Favour and Divine Preſence, that you may live to his Glory and Praiſe, and Die in Peace, and be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered into that bleſſed and Heavenly <hi>Aſſembly, and Church of the First-born which are written in Heaven, and to God the Judg of all, and the Spirits of Juſt men made perfect, and to Jeſus the Mediator of the New Covenant, and the Blood of Sprinkling that ſpeaketh bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things than that of Abel;</hi> That you may Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally Magnifie and Celebrate the praiſes of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal God, to whom be Glory for Ever, and Ever, <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <head>A SERMON Preached by Mr. WILLIAM PENN. At <hi>Wheeler-Street,</hi> April 13. 1694.</head>
               <p>IT is the Great Cauſe and Work of God in which you are all concerned this day, Now that all of you may ſee how you quit your ſelves before the Living Eternal God your Maker, and Anſwer the Viſitations of his Love in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of your Duty, that you may feel an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of Peace in your own Boſoms, and find your ſelves nigh who were afar off, that you may all know your ſelves nerer then when ye firſt believed, nearer to the Lord, nearer to his Love, and more in his Favour, that you may perceive your Intereſt to grow and increaſe your Divine, your Eternal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, that which will out-laſt the World for it Centers in that which ſhall never have an end; O Friends, ſee to it this Day, it is the Redemption of your Immortal Souls, that the Lord God hath viſited you for, it is in order to this; And all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions in the World, Articles, Creeds, Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:46240:42"/> and Profeſſions that leave out this, they are all Imperfect and inſignificant and will not avail Men in the Great Day of Account.</p>
               <p>Therefore ſee to it how the Work goes on, the Work of your Redemption and Salvation, Do you feel your ſelves near to the Lord? Do you find your ſelves to have more Power over your Souls? Do you know your ſelves advanced in the Work of God? Are ye come to dye daily to that which is contrary to the Lord? For as you dye daily, you live that Life, you <hi>Live in the Fleſh by the Faith of the Eternal Son of God Chriſt Jeſus, who hath Redeemed you from all Iniquity, and called you to Glory and Vertue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now that you may all be Faithful Stewards of the Grace and Mercy, and Heavenly Talents which God hath beſtowed upon you, and be all found working, not Idle in the Market Place; Chriſt Jeſus the Lord hath not been wanting to you, He hath Piped to you, have you Danced? He hath mourned have you wept? He hath called, have you Anſwered his Call? See to it this Day, for the glorious Power and Preſence of that God that viſited you in the beginning, is here this Day. It is his Heart-reaching Power, his Heart-melting Power, his Divine ſweet Preſence which brought us out of <hi>Pharoah's</hi> Houſe, and out of <hi>Egypt's</hi> Land, and took us by the hand and led us peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to walk by the Rivers of Gods Pleaſures; I ſay, ſee to it this day that you may anſwer the great Love of God, that the Lord doth vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe his Heavenly Preſence in the midſt of you, and lift up the Light of his Countenance upon you, that ye may be found anſwering his Love in his renewed Bleſſings, that as he reneweth his Mercies,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:46240:43"/> you may renew your Obedience, and as he renews his Loving kindneſs, you may renew your Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, that your Souls may be filled with high Praiſes, for it is a Day of Praiſes for the Lord, they who have obtained a Deliverance by Gods mighty Arm and Power, that brought his People out of <hi>Egypt</hi>'s Land into the Wilderneſs, and through the <hi>Red-Sea</hi> and over <hi>Jordan</hi>'s River, unto the Banks of Salvation, they who have received a marvellous Deliverance from their Spiritual Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, they do not hang their Harps upon the Willows but Rejoice and Praiſe the Living God, they reſolve with the Prophet, <hi>Although the Fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree ſhall not bloſſome, neither ſhall Fruit be in the Vine, the Labour of the Olive ſhall fail, and the Fields ſhall yield no Meat, the Flock ſhall be cut off from the Fold,</hi> and there ſhall be no Herd in the Stalls, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' there be Plague. Sword, Fire, Deſolation and Deſtruction: <hi>Yet we will rejoice in the Lord, we will joy in the God of our Salvation.</hi> Is it ſo with you this Day? Are you come into this Divine Fellowſhip, into this Intimacy with the Lord, have you this Holy Frame of Soul?</p>
               <p>O ye Sons and Daughters of the Morning, the Everlaſting Day of God hath dawned upon you, that you may look into your Hearts, and ſee how it is with you, and ſee your experiences, ſee the things that your Eyes have ſeen, and your hands have handled; You have taſted the good Word of God, and known the Operation of his Power, theſe are things that they have that are Children, not empty Notions but Experiences; If we travel on we ſhall be enabled to overcome, and if we take unto us the <hi>whole Armour of God,</hi> we ſhall be enabled to <hi>ſtand in the Evil Day, and having done all to ſtand,</hi>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:46240:43"/> and what is the reward of them that overcome? they ſhall eat of the Fruit of the Tree of Life, that grows in the Paradiſe of God, as many as are fed from this Tree, they are not to be ſtanding Idle, but <hi>Work the Works of God,</hi> and are brought into the Paradiſe of God, and enjoy the Delights of God in the Preſence of God, and the Lord will fill and ſatisfie them with his Divine Goodneſs, and they ſhall grow and encreaſe in the Divine Life more and more.</p>
               <p>Conſider how doth the Work go on? Conſider the Lord Jeſus he came in our Natures, before he cometh into our Hearts: Now <hi>Chriſt Jeſus within us is the Hope of Glory, and the Myſtery that was hid from Ages and Generations is now Revealed in us, Chriſt is now come,</hi> not only into our Natures bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This is an Ancient Teſtimony, when you were firſt turned to the Light of Chriſt, it was not a Natural but a Divine Light that you were turned to, the Light of Jeſus manifeſting himſelf in us, in this Light you received him, and I deſire to know what you have taſted, what ſurther Joy is

               <p>Here is Divinity, here is that which was before the World began, here is made known the Divine Nature. It is teſtified here that you might be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of it, that you might be a <hi>choſen Generation, a Royal Prieſthood, a Holy Nation, a Peculiar People that you ſhould ſhew forth the Praiſes of him who hath called you out of Darkneſs into his marvellous Light;</hi> ſee how this Work advanceth in every one of you, that you may be faithful and improve your Tallents, that you may be able to give up your account to the Lord <hi>with Joy, and not with Grief;</hi> When you ſhall hear a Voice ſaying, Come, come away There is no more Time, the Glaſs is Run, then how joyfully wilt thou hear that Voice, if thou haſt not been Idle but Working out thy Salvation, and anſwering the Call of God, and adoring him for his Love to thy Immortal Soul: thou art not like <hi>Martha cumbred about many things,</hi> but mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt <hi>the one thing needful, that good part that ſhall not be taken away from thee.</hi> If you thus Work out your Salvation, it will be ſaid unto you <hi>Well Done,</hi> not Well Taught, not well Diſputed, but, <hi>Well Done good and faithful Servants, enter you into the Joy of your Lord</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My Friends, Time goes apace, and we are wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off, and in a little while we ſhall be here no more; Time will be gone, and the Day of your Viſitation quickly over, the Thought and Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of this hath affected me many a time; Look Friends that you be all travelling on in your Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Journey as a faithful people, and that the Work of your Salvation is carrying on, and that is Chriſt is a Redeemer to you, and that he doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver

                     <hi>MOST Glorious and Infinite God of Heaven and Earth, in thy great and unſpeakable Mercy thou Vifiteſt the Children of Men, and extendeſt thy Love from one Generation to another, and yet in this Age in which we live thy Day of Grace and Mercy reaches unto our Souls, and we have been called by thee unto Righteouſneſs and Holineſs, that ſo it might be well with us when we ſhall be removed out of this World, and be no more ſeen of Men. Everlaſting God, If we conſider aright thy dealing towards us, the exceeding Riches of thy Grace in Chriſt Jeſus, It may provoke us and conſtrain us to Love thee, and fear thee, and ſerve thee in our Generation; Lord thy Viſitation hath been effectual upon the Hearts of many of the Children of Men who are Devoted to thy fear and ſervice, and give up themſelves to Worſhip thee in the Beauties of Holineſs, Lord thou haſt Gathered a People to thy ſelf, and thou haſt brought them through many trials and Exerciſes, and reſined them by a Spirit of Judgment, and they have been Baptized with the Holy Ghoſt and with Fire, O Lord God of Life, thy Mercy is exceeding great and thy Love unſpeakable in all the Dimenſions of it, we pray thee that thou wilt be pleaſed to grant according to the Riches of thy Glory that we may all be ſtrengthened with might by thy Spirit in our inner man, that Chriſt may dwell in our Hearts by Faith; that we being rooted and grounded in Love, may be able to comprehend with all Saints what is the Breadth, and Depth, and Height, and length, and to know the Love of Chriſt which paſſeth knowledge that we may be filled with all the fulneſs of God; Bleſſed Father of Mercies, deliver us from this preſent evil World, and</hi>

                  </gap>gnorant of it, and have been ready to reflect on thoſe that Admire it and have an high eſteem of it.</p>
               <p>But bleſſed be the Lord our God that we can ſay in Truth that we have an eſteem of that one offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Eternal Son of God, that we can ſay as the Apoſtle did in his Day. <hi>By one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are Sanctified;</hi> This is that which hath opened upon my Soul this Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; The Lord God of Glory in this Age and Generation hath laid a neceſſity upon us to Preach Chriſt under the Denomination of a glorious Light, for he is the Light of the World and the only Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour and ſo we are to have Faith in him.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtles made it their Work to perſuade the People from Morning to Evening, that Jeſus was the Chriſt, the true Meſiah, that made a good Confeſſion before <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> and that he was Crucified, Died, and Roſe again, and aſcended up into Heaven, and ſitteth at the Right hand of God, and lives for ever to make Interceſſion for us; This was the Labour, Travel and Exerciſe of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles to Preach Chriſt Crucified and Riſen from the Dead, <hi>But the Jews Aſſembled with the Chief Prieſts, and Elders to take Counſel together, and gave large Money to the Souldiers, ſaying, ſay ye his Diſciples came by Night, and ſtole him away while we ſlept;</hi> This was the Labour of the Apoſtles, and Servants
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:46240:48"/> of the Lord, to perſuade the People in their Day that Jeſus was the Chriſt, and that after he was Crucified and Died, he was riſen from the Dead, but the <hi>Jews,</hi> the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſes</hi> they did op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe this, and ſaid he was not the Promiſed <hi>Meſſiah;</hi> But in proceſs of time through the powerful Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Goſpel, the Children of Men did Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and believe this Teſtimony, that Jeſus was the Chriſt, the Eternal Son of God and only Saviour, and when the Enemy could no longer withſtand that Belief, when it came over the Nations, then the People were turned about, and then there was an Admiſſion of that Belief that Jeſus was the Chriſt, and many contented themſelves with the bare Name of Chriſt, and with a Profeſſion of the Word, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Power.</p>
               <p>But the Lord of Glory hath raiſed a People in this Age and Generation, as Inſtruments that might ſhew forth the Power and coming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt Spiritually, not thereby denying or not in the leaſt oppoſing his manifeſtation bodily, which died without the Gates of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> for this was the end of his manifeſtation, <hi>For this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>was the Son of God manifeſted that he might deſtroy the Works of the Devil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that now Friends, That which opens and lives in my Soul, and that which I have to ſay, and demonſtrate to you at this time is this, That the Lord God of Heaven and Earth, hath raiſed up a People in our Day to Preach Chriſt under that Denomination, that the Servants of the Lord Preached Chriſt in former Days, Ages and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations; They gave teſtimony on this wiſe, <hi>In the beginning was the word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God, the ſame was in the beginning</hi>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:46240:48"/> 
                  <hi>with God, all things were made by him, and without him was not any thing made that was made, in him was Life and that Life was the Light of Men, and the Light ſhined in Darkneſs, and the Darkneſs comprehended it not. There was a man ſent from God whoſe Name was</hi> John, <hi>the ſame came for a Witneſs, to bear Witneſs of that Light, that all men through him might believe, He was not that Light but was ſent to bear Witneſs of that Light, that was the true light that Lighteth every man that cometh into the World, he was in the World and the World was made by him, and the World knew him not, He came to his own, and his own received him not; But as many as received him to them gave he Power to become the Sons of God to them that believe on his Name.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Did the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> that gave Teſtimony of Chriſt, as the Light of the World, oppoſe his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance in that Body that was prepared for him of the Father to do his Will in? No, no more then the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> who Preached his Spiritual Appearance, and manifeſtation, oppoſed his bodily Appearance, and being manifeſt in Fleſh, when he ſaith, <hi>The Grace of God which brings Salvation hath appeared to all men, teaching us that Denying, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs, and Worldly Luſts, we ſhould live ſoberly, righteouſly, and Godly in this preſent World;</hi> No more do we deny or oppoſe Chriſt's bodily appearance, who Died without the Gates of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> Though we are miſunderſtood, and miſrepreſented by many in this Generation; The Lord in mercy by his Heavenly power remove this miſunderſtanding and take away this Vail from the Hearts of the Children of Men, and ſo bring them to a ſenſe and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Spiritual Appearance of Chriſt Jeſus, and the bleſſed end of his coming in that bleſſed body wherein he ſuffered, and <hi>taſted Death for every</hi>

               <p>And now to give a little eaſe to my Spirit, I would ſpeak ſomething briefly to you, let the Love of God in Chriſt Jeſus extended to you affect your Hearts, if you are in the living ſenſe of this love, it will engage you to live in Obedience and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to this Heavenly <hi>Light,</hi> by which you were <hi>brought out of Darkneſs, and Redeemed from Iniquity to be a peculiar People, Zealous of good Works;</hi> It will engage you to live to Chriſt that died for you; and as you know a Tranſlation from the Kingdom of Darkneſs into the Kingdom of God's dear Son, you will Reap the Fruits and benefits of his Death, Reſurrection and Aſcenſion, and Interceſſion at God's Right hand; The Lord God of Heaven and Earth open all your Hearts, that while you have a little time, and are on this ſide the Grave, and on this ſide Eternity, you may ſerve the Lord in your Generation, and fulfil his bleſſed Will and finiſh the Work which he hath given you to do, that you may Glorifie the Name of the Lord God of Heaven and Earth, who is worthy of all Praiſe, Glory, and Renown Worſhip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

O God of Glory and Soveraign Lord of Heaven and Earth, it is in the Power of thy hand to open the Hearts of thy People, as thou didſt open the Heart of <hi>Lydia,</hi> that the things that belong to the Peace of every Soul may be ſeen, known and experienced. Lord God of Glory, our Eyes are unto thee, and our Souls are bowed before thee, for the ſhewing of mercy, and the handing forth of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, which thou promiſed'ſt to the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> by the mouth of thy Holy Prophets; That thou living Father of Life, wilt bleſs them in turning every one from their Iniquities and the Evil of thtir ways; for Lord God of Life, this is greatly wanting both in this City, and throughout the whole Nation; Thy mercies and Favours have been received by many, and thy loving kindneſs hath extended it ſelf wonderfully; O Glorious Fountain of Heavenly Love and Life, be pleaſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move that Inſenſibility that is ready to come over the minds of men, that the nearer thy Wrath and Judgments do approach to us, by reaſon of that Inundation of Sin, and Wickedneſs that overflows the Land, the leſs Senſe and Apprehenſion there is of it; Lord open the Peoples Eyes and Hearts that they may ſee, and conſider the danger of their State and Condition, and be humbled for their Sin, and ſeek thy Face, and turn to thee with all their Hearts, that, Glorious God of Life, the Souls

               <head>A SERMON, Preached by Mr. RICHARD ASHBY. At St. <hi>Martins Le Grand. Feb.</hi> 16. 1693.</head>
               <p>THE Teſtimonies and Declarations which are given forth in obedience to the Lords requirings, are to bring every one of you to a ſenſe and feeling of the Inward Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Truth in your own Boſoms, to the feeling of the Work and Operation of the Lords Spirit, upon your Hearts, to give to every one a clear ſight and underſtanding of thoſe things that tend to their Souls profit, and to their Spiritual advantage and a Divine growth in Grace. If any of us are ſatisfying our ſelves in ſitting down in an outward Gathering, and only exerciſing our natural facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to hear and to underſtand, and come not to know and be acquainted in our ſelves, with the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration of the Almighty, the Word of Truth, we are Strangers to it, and the good and excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of it is hid from our Eyes.</p>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:46240:54"/>
               <p>So that it is matter of great concernment for every one to know what it is to be inwardly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired, and to know the Operation of Gods Gift upon their Souls, and to be acquainted with the Work of Gods Spirit in their inward parts, elſe we ſhall be deficient in learning what we ought to know, and fall ſhort of certainty in our knowledg, and we ſhall be among the number of thoſe <hi>that are always Learning and</hi> never come to any ſtability, and come not to the power, and to know the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of all; ſuch are in the Dark, they are grop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the Wall, they are at uncertainty, and toſſed too and fro, and have not a ſtability of Mind and Spirit attending them, and they come not to know a true Exerciſe; though there may be ſome inward deſires, yet for want of keeping to that Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er by which they are begotten, their deſires ſeem to fail.</p>
               <p>O my Friends, that every one of you may be ponderous and weighty, that in your minds you may feel the operation of that Power, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Work of Truth that is begun in the Soul, as the Foundation of Eternal Happineſs that is laid, that we may know the Inſtruction and feel the Power of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in the Heavenly Goſpel in which he is carrying on the Work of our Salvation, that we have an Eye unto Jeſus and our expectations from him, and be waiting truly upon him for Experience to come to know him that is the Author and Beginner of the Work of Faith in our Souls and lays the Foundation of Eternal Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city; Theſe are ſuch as walk on gradually and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere to the end, they <hi>look unto Jeſus the Author and F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:46240:54"/> Intents thereof; They come to know him in his Offices as he diſcovers and makes known to man and ſheweth unto him what it is that doth obſtruct and prevent his enjoyment of Peace; They that come to be ſenſible of this, come to know an Inward Travel of Soul, and are brought to a Spiritual exerciſe that hath a profitable tendency, ſo that now they, diſcover thoſe things that are pleaſing to the ſight of their Minds, not thoſe things that pleaſe the carnal deſire, and bring reproof unto the Soul.</p>
               <p>Here is the proper effect of Faith, when there is Impreſſed upon the Soul a ſenſe of Sin, and of the Works of Unrighteouſneſs, and here is a Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion laid for true Repentance, towards God and Faith in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, for ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Him hath God exalted with his own Right Hand, to be a Prince and a Saviour, to give Repentance and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Sins.</hi> He gives Repentance to thoſe that come to feel their Need of a Phiſician to heal them, he makes ſuch a diſcovery to their Souls, ſuch a ſenſe he gives of their Sin and Tranſgreſſion, as makes it appear exceeding ſinful; Theſe are ſuch as come to reflect upon themſelves, and ſee their woful ſtate, this will lay low their Minds, and bow down their Spirits; theſe are they that come to Self-abhorrence, and to have a Travel in their Spirits, and they come down into a lowly ſtate, according to what the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Lam. 2. 29. He fitteth alone and keepeth ſilence, He putteth his Mouth in the Duſt, If ſo be there may be hope: Wherefore doth a Living Man Complain, a Man for the Puniſhment of his Sins? It is of the Lords Mercies that we are not conſumed, becauſe his Compaſſions fail not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They that come to be acquainted with the Lord
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:46240:55"/> as a Judge and as a Reprover, here is a Deciſion made in the Soul, and a Separation from Sin, after it is diſcovered, and the Judgment of God takes hold of the Sin and Trangreſſion, and a man comes under Reproof; Here is a time of ſuffering, and here is ſorrow taking hold of him: here is that which affects the Soul with grief, and brings it into a ſtate of Mourning, and he is brought under a ſenſe of Gods dealings with him, and he comes to know that ſorrow that hath an Inward effect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Soul, to take away Iniquity, and make the Heart better; He ſubmits to the diſcovery of that Deceitfulneſs that is lodged in the Heart. For ſaith the Prophet, <hi>The Heart is deceitful above all things, and deſperately wicked, who can know it? I the Lord ſearch the Heart, I try the Reins even to give to every man according to his ways, and according to the Fruit of bis doings.</hi> The Apoſtle ſpeaking to ſome, of the Heart being turned unto the Lord, ſaid, <hi>then the Vail ſhall be taken away;</hi> As God inwardly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to a man, there muſt be an humble ſubmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his ſearching of the Heart, therefore faith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>(Pſalm</hi> 19. 12.) <hi>Who can underſtand his Errors, cleanſe thou me from ſecret faults;</hi> and he knew a cleanſing Work in his own Heart, <hi>Pſalm 51. 10. Create in me a Clean Heart O God, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new a right Spirit in me; Caſt me not away from thy Preſence, take not thy Holy Spirit from me, reſtore unto me the Joy of thy Salvation, and uphold me with thy free Spirit.</hi> The Pſalmiſt was in a Spiritual Travel, and came to an experience of this Work upon his Soul, and he prays the Lord to uphold him that what he had done might not be marr'd again: therefore he begs of God to uphold him with his free Spirit.</p>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:46240:55"/>
               <p>You ſhould all labour to go on in this Inward Travel that will bring you to a <hi>Repentance, not to be Repented of,</hi> and to have a profitable Evidence that there is fruit brought forth, not the Fruit of Sin, <hi>What fruit have you of thoſe things whereof you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The Work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance ſtands in this, not only in denying all Ungodlineſs, but in <hi>abſtaining from all appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of evil.</hi> Therefore ſtand upon thy guard againſt thine Enemy, that he may not prevail againſt thee by his Aſſaults. <hi>If ſinners intice thee conſent not to them, go not in the way of evil men turn aſide from it and paſs away;</hi> Learn Self denial which our Lord Jeſus Chriſt doth declare to be of neceſſity: <hi>Except a many Deny himſelf, and take up his Croſs and follow me, he cannot be my Diſciple.</hi>

               <p>Thou may'ſt appear to take up a Croſs and deny thy Self, but there muſt be a daily Croſs, a deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thy ſelf continually, not giving way to our Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Wills, to our own Carnal Minds, <hi>for to be Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally minded is Death, and to be Spiritually minded is Life and Peace.</hi>

               <p>Here is a Work that produceth profitable Fruit, that will not bring Reproach and Shame, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion upon us, the Work of the Spirit of the Lord hath not that tendency, but will bring the Soul to poſſeſs Vertue, to inherit Glory, <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs that exalts a Nation, but Sin is the Reproach of any People,</hi> Sin brings a man to ſhame and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Face, becauſe there is a ſenſe comes upon a man that <hi>God will bring every Work into Judgment,</hi>

He hath ſhewed thee O Man what is good, and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do Juſtly, and to love Mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God.</hi> This the Prophet tells us is more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual and efficacious than Sacrifices under the Law.</p>
               <p>Be faithful (my Friends) to what God makes known, and give up in Obedience to the Works of Righteouſneſs, and live to the Glory of God, and in Obedience to the Truth.

The Love of Chriſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraineth us becauſe we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead, and that he died for all, that they which live ſhould not henceforth live unto themſelves but unto him which Died for them and Roſe again,</hi> And therefore the Apoſtle comes to declare of thoſe, to this effect, <hi>He that is in Chriſt, is a new Creature, old things are paſſed away, behold all things are become New.</hi> How is he a New Creature? <hi>He is the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip of God Created in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Oh the Work of the new Creation, How precious is it to be Witneſſed to! <hi>All things are of God, who hath reconciled us himſelf by Jeſus Chriſt, and hath given to us the Miniſtry of Reconciliation.</hi> And ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> Eph. 2. 14. <hi>For he is our peace having made both one, and hath broken down the Wall of Partition between us, having abo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>the Father, and with his Son Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> They that come to know this, know God to be with them, and do know Gods Power and Preſence in the midſt of them; Then though man may frown, the Light of Gods Countenance ſhall be lifted up upon us, And <hi>If God be for us,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>who can be againſt us. He that ſpared not his own Son, but deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered him up for us all, How ſhall he not with him alſo freely give us all good things. The Lord will bleſs us with all Spiritual bleſſings in Heavenly Places in Chriſt.</hi> Wait upon the Lord and he will bleſs thee and encourage thee, that thou mayſt know additional bleſſings in thy Soul.</p>
               <p>This is the intent, deſign, and import of theſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations that are found among you, that you may all know a being gathered unto the Lord, and may feel his Power and know the Lot of your Souls Inheritance; and know that the Lord will continue his mercies to you, and will make good his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, that if you <hi>caſt your care upon him he will take care of you,</hi> they that do this may know the <hi>Lord to be their Portion, and the Lot of their Inheritance</hi> to be in him; In times of diſtreſs and tribulation, the Lord will be with them; <hi>Iſrael</hi> of Old tho' they did all partake of an outward <hi>Canaan,</hi> yet all had not their Lot in <hi>Shilo,</hi> They that come to ſit with Chriſt in Heavenly places, they have their Lot in <hi>Shilo,</hi> in a Peaceable Saviour, <hi>the Prince of Peace;</hi> Take a view of your inward ſtate and condition, ſee, is the Lord Jeſus your Lot and Portion, then you ſhall not want, but if you are Strangers to this, and live in the ſtate of carnal ſecurity, ſorrow will overtake you; The Prophet ſaw ſome to do ſo; <hi>It is as when a Hungry Man Dreams of Refreſhment, but when he awakes his Soul</hi>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:46240:59"/> 
                  <hi>is empty and faint;</hi> If you have not the feeling of the Power of Gods Spirit, and are at eaſe, a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Day will overtake you.</p>
               <p>Therefore Friends while you have time, give all diligence while the <hi>Manna</hi> falls about your Tents, and are humbled in the ſence thereof, know that the Lord will preſerve you from day to day, then your Bread will be ſweet, and your Water ſure; O Friends, The Great Prophet hath been ſent to you, <hi>Behold I ſtand at the Door and knock, if any Man hear my Voice and open the Door, I will come into him, and will ſup with him and he with me;</hi> Friends, He will bleſs you and you ſhall know your Proviſions which are made for you, the Lord Chriſt will bleſs your ſtore, for the Treaſures of Heaven fail not, <hi>where Moth and Ruſt doth not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, nor Theives break through nor Steal;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Friends have reſpect to the manifeſtation and Spiritual Appearance of the Lord Jeſus, that you may feel his Power overſhaddowing you from day to day, that you may be kept by the Mighty Power of God; We muſt wait upon the Lord from day to day, to be kept and preſerved by him, and be retired from the Vanities of the World, and live that <hi>Life we live in the fleſh, by the Faith of the Son of God,</hi> that we may come to ſay with the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, Not I live, but Chriſt liveth in me that we may be united, to him; He that hath the Son hath Life. and he hath Power, to as many as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him to them he gave Power;</hi> Here is a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Ability, <hi>I can do all things through Chriſt which ſtrengthens me.</hi> My Friends, If every one of you do feel this in your own particular, you will come to a Heavenly place, <hi>to a Kingdom that cannot be ſhaken,</hi> and dwell in a ſure dwelling, <hi>and</hi>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:46240:59"/> 
                  <hi>have the Candle of the Lord to ſhine upon your Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles, light is ſown for the Righteous, and gladneſs for the upright in Heart,</hi> they ſhall have Peace through him that is the Prince of Peace; It is the deſire of my Soul that you may feel this inwardly in your ſelves.</p>
               <p>Therefore Dear Friends, retire to that ſtrength that is Treaſured up for you in Chriſt, <hi>Be strong in the Lord, and in the Power of his might,</hi> and let all ſelf Confidence be laid aſide, and <hi>truſt in the Lord for in the Lord Jehovah is everlasting strength, and he changeth not, therefore the Sons of</hi> Jacob <hi>are not conſumed, He is the ſame Yeſterday, to Day and for ever;</hi> Let us take comfort in the unchangeable Love of God who hath given us this Promiſe, <hi>I will never leave thee nor forſake thee,</hi> 13. Heb. 5. 6. <hi>So that we may boldly ſay, the Lord is my helper and I will not fear what man ſhall do unto me.</hi> Therefore wait to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſtrength from Chriſt, from day to day, they that build not upon this Power are upon a Sandy foundation, they make an outward profeſſion of Religion, and have a <hi>form of Godlineſs,</hi> but that will not avail, <hi>Obedience is better then Sacrifice, and to hearken then the Fat of Rams;</hi> And our Saviour ſaith, Mat. 7. 22. <hi>And every one that heareth theſe ſayings of mine and doth them not, ſhall be likened to a fooliſh man that built his Houſe upon the Sand, and the Rain deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Floods came and the Winds blew and beat upon that Houſe and it fell, and great was the fall of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wait upon the Lord, his ſtrength hath been Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, and his power made known, and his Arm made bare; Therefore fix your Confidence in him, that ſo your minds may be eſtabliſhed, <hi>Be ſtrong in the Lord and in the Power of his might, and take unto you the whole Armour of God,</hi> Eph. 6. 13, 14. This
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:46240:60"/> is the Armour that God hath made known for his Chriſtian Souldiers that are making War againſt ſin and unrighteouſneſs, who are <hi>fighting the good fight of Faith;</hi> It was the experience of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Believers, <hi>We are more then Conquerours through him that loved us,</hi> therefore feel your ſtrength fixed upon the Lord, retire and wait upon him, and be in a watchful frame; The Prophet <hi>Habbakuk,</hi> when he ſaw diſtreſs was coming upon the Church ſays, <hi>Hab. 3. 16. When I heard, my belly trembled, and my Lips quivered at the Voice, and Rottenneſs entred into my bones, and I trembled in my ſelf that I might reſt in the Day of trouble,</hi> then ſaith he in the 2 Chap. 1. <hi>I will ſtand upon my Watch, and ſet me upon the Tower, and I will watch to ſee what he will ſay unto me, and what I ſhall Anſwer when I am Reproved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this Spiritual Warfare let us be attentive un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt, the great Captain of our Salvation that maketh War in Righteouſneſs, let us hearken one day after another, and then there will be a Holy skill and expertneſs given to us, you will be expert in the Spiritual War, and you will find ſtrength and power given you from the Lord and he will be <hi>a hiding place,</hi> and a <hi>Sanctuary</hi> to you, you ſhall come to the Mountain of the Lord where there ſhall be no diſtreſs, and <hi>the Voice of the oppreſſor ſhall no more be heard, nor deſtruction within your Walls, Thy Walls ſhall be called Salvation, and thy Gates praiſe;</hi> And you that know that Spiritual dwelling, where the Spiritual <hi>Jews</hi> are, you are come to ſing the Songs of <hi>Zion,</hi> which ſhall be Sung in the ſtrong City, <hi>where Salvation is appointed for Walls and Bulwarks, where the wicked ceaſe from troubling, and where the Flocks lye down at Noon, where there is a Shaddow of a great Rock in a weary Land, and Rivers in dry</hi>

                  <hi>places;</hi> Here is the plenty of all good things which in Gods Houſe is opened to us.</p>
               <p>Now my Friends, If you are ſitting down in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward forms without feeling the operation of Gods Power and Spirit upon your Souls, and be not brought to an inward Conformity, the dreadful day will come that <hi>the Lord will ſearch Jeruſalem with Candles;</hi> that God before whom all things are naked and bare, he is taking a view of the Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of his People, <hi>he is the ſearcher of the Heart and a diſcerner of the thoughts and intents of it,</hi> whether you fall ſhort of that power and Spirit of true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, or if there be only an outward Conformity and not inward Obedience; The Trumpet of the Lord hath been blown in <hi>Sion, Lift up thy Voice like a Trumpet, and tell the Houſe of Judah of her tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, and the Houſe of Iſrael of her Sins;</hi> Where there is only an outward Conformity, and not an Inward ſubjection, there diſtreſs will overtake you which I have ſeen in the Viſion of the Lord (which hath been upon me as a warning to the Remiſs and careleſs ones) and it was delivered with a voice full of Power in theſe words; <hi>All foundations ſhall be manifeſted of what ſort they are; A watcher from the Holy one with ſeverity ſhall overtake the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>watchful.</hi> Therefore let this be a warning to you all, that you may not fall under the ſtroke of Gods ſeverity; The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 17. to the believing <hi>Romans,</hi> ſpeaking of the goodneſs and ſeverity of God. <hi>And if ſome of he Branches be broken off, and thou being a Wild Olive Tree, wert graft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in amongſt them, and with them partakeſt of the Root and fatneſs of the Olive Tree; Boaſt not againſt the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, but if thou boaſt thou beareſt not the Root, but the Root thee, Thou wilt ſay then, the Branches were broken
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:46240:61"/> off, that I might be grafted in; Well becauſe of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief they were broken off, and thou ſtandeſt by Faith, be not bigh minded but fear, For if God ſpared not the natural branches, take heed leaſt be alſo ſpare not thee. Behold therefore the Goodneſs and Severity of God, on them which fell, to them ſeverity, but towards thee Goodneſs, if thou continue in his Goodneſs otherwiſe thou ſhalt be Cut off.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O my Friends, what need is there of a Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful frame, think how neceſſary it is in your own particular, every one of you to be keeping in your Watch Tower, <hi>the Name of the Lord is a ſtrong Tower, The Righteous ſhall fly unto it, and be ſafe,</hi> and when they are aſſaulted with the Enemy, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Lord ſhall be with them, and <hi>when the Enemy comes upon them as a Flood, the Spirit of the Lord ſhall lift up a Standard for them againſt the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary, and they ſhall ſtand ſtill, and ſee the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God;</hi> And they ſhall find the Power of Gods Spirit come upon them for Sanctification, and they ſhall be as the pureſt Wheat gathered into the Garner of God</p>
               <p>Therefore My Friends, let the Teſtimonies of Truth which the Lord is pleaſed by his Servants and Meſſengers to ſend to you, take hold of you, and go along with you, and have a place in your ſecret thoughts; It is an Exhortation of the Word of Truth, which God gives by his Spirit to you, therefore let it be retained, <hi>While you are in the Light, walk as Children of Light, and have no Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nfruitful Works of Darkneſs, and you ſhall dwell ſafely, and be ſet upon a Rock that is higher than you,</hi> you ſhall be as Stars ſhining in a Dark World, and though there be darkneſs upon the Earth, yet here is Light, here is Beauty; Thoſe that are in <hi>Zion</hi> and in <hi>Goſhen,</hi> the Songs of the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:46240:61"/> Night ſhall be given to them; When others are in diſtreſs, theſe are they that have their Habitation in the Lord, and find a Spiritual repoſe, and enter into Reſt, and enjoy that peace which God through Jeſus Chriſt his Beloved Son doth give unto the Souls of his People, that <hi>Peace that Paſſeth <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding; Let the Word of Chriſt dwell in you richly, in all Wiſdom, Teaching and Admoniſhing one another in Pſalms and Hymns, and Spiritual Songs, ſinging with Grace in your Hearts unto the Lord. Salvation and Praiſe be aſcribed unto our God continually for all his Mercies and Favours, for to him Honour and Glory and Thanks giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing belongs;</hi> And as you render Praiſe to the Lord in the Name of his Beloved Son, you ſhall find ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance with him, and an anſwer of Peace re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned into your Boſoms, when you pray as the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal. 141. 1, 2. Lord I cry unto thee, make baſt unto me, give ear to my Voice, when I cry unto thee, let my Prayer be ſet forth before thee as Incenſe, and the lifting up my hands as the Evening Sacrifice;</hi> Hereby you ſhall enjoy Divine Reſt, and Repoſe, and Refreſhment from the preſence of the Lord, and that <hi>Joy that is unſpeakable and full of Glory;</hi> This is my Deſire and Souls Travel, and the end of my Labour among you, that this may be your Lot and Portion with the Lord.</p>

                  <salute>Friends,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>IT is weighty upon my Spirit this Day to call upon you all, to take into a weighty conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, the end for which the Everlaſting God hath given us a Being, and a day of Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and doth vouchſafe to us the continuance of our Lives, without all controverſie the Great God hath a great end in it, I would to God the conſideration of this end did take impreſſion upon your minds; Certainly it is for this in the firſt place, that Man ſhould Serve and Glorify the Great God that gave Life and Breath, and Being to him; for this is an indiſpenſible duty, and in the next place, there is a Duty towards man, ſo that there is our Duty to God, and our Duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our Neighbour.</p>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:46240:63"/>
               <p>Now that we may be capable of Anſwering theſe things, that we may be rightly fitted and qualified, that this great end of God may be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that is our Duty to God, which every one ought to perform, and I doubt not is acknowledged generally by all to be due to him; It is therefore to be conſidered under what Qualifications thoſe muſt be that can perform it acceptably; Now God, who hath required the ſtrict performance of this Duty is a Holy Eternal Being, Pure and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, whatſoever then is offered to him, muſt be a pure Offering, and the Heart and Mind of the Offerer muſt be pure and Holy, if it find accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with him.</p>
               <p>Now if it be ſo as without all controverſie it is; In the firſt place, you know as God created Man for this end and purpoſe, to glorifie him, ſo he created him in a meet ſtate and capacity to perform it, for he made Man Upright, Holy and Righteous and whilſt he ſtood thus he had both free acceſs and acceptance with God his Maker; But alaſs Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind through the Workings of Satan, and through the craftineſs and ſubtilty of the Enemy of all Righteouſneſs, loſt this Innocent ſtate of Holineſs, fell from it, and became a Plant of a degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Vine; yet many are not ſo far fallen, but that they have a ſenſe ſometimes, and believe there is a Duty and Service owing to God, and have gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to perform it, though they have not been right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly qualified, for we find that <hi>Iſrael</hi> they went about to perform this great duty in their unregenerate ſtate, what acceptance did they find? none at all, why? there Hearts were corrupt; we have divers Inſtances thereof in Scripture, concerning <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the Lord complains of them by his Prophets; He
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:46240:64"/> doth not complain that they were ſhort in not going about to do ſomething that had the ſhew of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, or in appearing in an outward ſhew of Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſomething to God; No, but it was not pleaſing for the Lord ſaith <hi>Bring no more vain Oblations,</hi> (Iſa. 1. 13.) <hi>Incenſe is an Abomination to me, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> I cannot away with. It is iniquity even the ſolem meeting;</hi> what was the reaſon they were not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable, was it that the Lord had not required thoſe things? No, What was the reaſon then? Their Hearts were full of Corruption, their Hearts were defiled, they were not right in the ſight of God, it ſprung from a wrong Heart, it was not a <hi>Veſſel made meet;</hi> It was not prepared and fit for ſuch holy Service and Oblation. And again in the ſame place, there they <hi>ſeemed to draw nigh to God, and would preſume to tread his Courts,</hi> but what was the return? <hi>When you come to appear before me, who hath required this thing at your hands, to tread my Courts, ſeeing you hate to be Reformed;</hi> theſe People drew near to God <hi>with their Lips, but their Hearts were far from him;</hi> And it is evident the Lord did not accept of them in thoſe performances, becauſe they were in a corrupt unclean ſtate, but the Lord by his Prophet corrected them on this wiſe, <hi>Waſh ye make ye clean, put away the evil of your doings from before mine Eyes, ceaſe to do Evil, learn to do well, ſeek Judgment, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the oppreſſed, Judge the Fatherleſs, plead for the Widdow. Come now and let us Reaſon together ſaith the Lord, though your ſins be as Scarlet, they ſhall be white as Snow, though they be Red like Crimſon, they ſhall be as Wool.</hi> Nothing but this change could give them acceptance with God.</p>
               <p>Now my Friends, this is a great Work, the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:46240:64"/> Work of the Day that every Man and Woman is concerned in, and ought to be concerned about, to be made meet to approach before the Lord, to come before him, and perform their duty that is due from them to God acceptably, but if any ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of me, by what means may we be made meet for this Service and great Undertaking? I will tell you, It muſt be by Experience, and ſenſible feeling of that which was the cauſe and real ground of mans loſing his acceſs to, and acceptance with God at the beginning, that which ſhut the Door and became a Bar and Partition Wall between God and Man, and that was the Sin and Tranſgreſſion that he fell into, this muſt be removed and taken away, the root of it muſt be done away by Faith in him whom God has ſent to Reſtore loſt man, Jeſus Chriſt, and by a ſenſible feeling the effectual working of his Power in the Soul, to cleanſe from Sin, or elſe there can be no acceptance with God. How and by what means muſt it be done away? God Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting in his Infinite Love, hath ordained a way, becauſe he would not have man to periſh and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in a ſtate uncapable of anſwering the end which God ordained him to, and what is that Way? The Lord Jeſus Chriſt, God hath ſent him into the World, in a twofold manner.</p>
               <p>Firſt, He ſent him into the World in a Holy Body which he had prepared for him, as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, <hi>Lo it is written in the Volume of the Book I come, what for? To do thy Will O God.</hi> What is Gods Will? And what is the reaſon of Chriſts coming into the World? That he might Die for every man, and be a Sacrifice for Sin, and Redeem Man to God, this was the Work that God gave him to do in that appearance.</p>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:46240:65"/>
               <p>Secondly, There is another coming of Chriſt a coming in the Spirit; for the firſt opened a Door for loſt Man, that ſhut himſelf out, and by his Sin put a Bar to his drawing near to God; the firſt coming of Chriſt, I ſay, opened a Door, for he became a Sacrifice and an Offering, and Attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for Mankind, and thereby opened a new and living Way for Mans coming to God. And <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>

They that are thus exerciſed, they Live to God, and in daily feeling of his Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Arm, and the Ranſoming power of the Lord which hath broken the Chains of Darkneſs in which they were held; and how the Lord hath

               <p>Secondly, As there is a duty we owe unto God, ſo there is a Duty which we owe to our Neighbour, and this Duty cannot be performed but as we are preſerved in a ſenſe of that power which hath quickned us to God; Therein we are made In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments in his hands to call upon others to turn to God, and do good to them by our Exemplary Lives, and that as we make a Profeſſion of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſo we ought to walk in Love, and have bowells of Compaſſion and Love to our Neighbours that they may be ſaved and brought near to God.

               <head>A SERMON, Preached by Mr. SAMUEL WALDENFIELD. At <hi>Devonſhire Houſe, March,</hi> 11. 1693.</head>
               <p>THERE is a Day of Viſitation which the Lord hath extended unto the Children of Men, that we might every one of us ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve our Seaſon and time, that ſo we might be Exerciſed in thoſe things that relate to our Everlaſting Peace, and welfare in the World to come; For we are like to be accountable to the Great God for the Deeds done in the Body: Therefore every one had need to weigh and meaſure their ways and doings, that they may ſtand Juſtified in the ſight of God through Jeſus Chriſt, by whom we are Viſited, who hath been given of the Father, not only to be a Light but a Leader to us, and bleſſed will all they be that come to be led by the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:46240:70"/>
               <p>For that is a very precious ſtate to know this <hi>One</hi> way, for he is the alone way to the Kingdom of God, and all thoſe that make a Profeſſion of him and reject his Leadings and his Counſel, they will fall ſhort, they will meet with many things in the way that will turn them from the right Way to the Kingdom of God; But all thoſe that follow the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, it is they that ſhall receive the Crown of Immortal and Everlaſting Life and Glory.</p>
               <p>For this following of Chriſt is a Crucifying the Old Nature of Man, it is a regenerating of Man in his Inward parts, without which none of us can come to ſee the Kingdom of God.</p>
               <p>This is not an outward Birth, nor an outward Generation, nor a growing into any outward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of things, but it is an Inward <hi>mortifying of the Deeds of the Fleſh,</hi> and that you know no Man can do, but by and through the Spirit, <hi>If Men walk after the fleſh they muſt dye, but if through the Spirit,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>ye mortifie the deeds of the Body ye ſhall Live;</hi> I do not ſpeak of outward living in this World only, but of living to God Eternally.</p>
               <p>People in this World ſhould live to the Lord, then it will be well with them whom they come to Dye; When this outward <hi>Earthly Tabernacle, and Houſe of Clay ſhall be diſſolved,</hi> all ſuch as live to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt the Eternal Son of God, they ſhall have an Habitation and a Dwelling with him in his Fathers Kingdom, they will be made Veſſels of Honor to glorifie the Lord; Therefore the greateſt matter, and thing that we can preſs after in this Life, the moſt profitable, the moſt advantagious of all things is, to preſs after an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward walking with God through Jeſus Chriſt, for
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:46240:71"/> ſaith Chriſt to his Diſciples, <hi>You that have followed me through the Work of Regeneration, it ſhall be given to you, to ſit with me in my Fathers Kingdom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now moſt People believe that theſe things are true, moſt that are called Chriſtians believe that they are profitable, but to purſue and preſs after them a great many are ſhort in it; Some it may be are hindred by the delights and pleaſures, and vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of this World, others it may be are hindred by ſome great Excerciſe that they meet withal, and ſome and ſome ſore Affliction, not knowing that Power that carries through and gives Victory, and that is the Power of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, ſo that the Knowledge of Chriſt is a very profitable thing; I look upon it to be as neceſſary to be Preached to many that call themſelves Chriſtians, as to a great many that are Heathens, for if a Man or Woman profeſs to be a Chriſtian, and be not of a Chriſtian Spirit and Converſation, What will it ſignifie? The Inſtance that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> gives concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Heathen,</hi> will be more prevalent in the Day of the Lord, and that is this, <hi>Rom. 2. 14. For when the Gentiles which have not the Law, do by Nature the things contained in the Law, theſe having not the Law, are a Law unto themſelves, which ſhew the Work of the Law written in their Hearts,</hi> No doubt but they were accepted of the Lord, according to their Integrity and Sincerity.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was an experienced Man, and underſtood the Nature, Quality, and greatneſs of the Law of God, which was diſpenced to the <hi>Jews</hi> and given them for peculiar Inſtruction, and for a School-Maſter to bring them to Chriſt, for it was never given to compleat Salvation to any Man without Chriſt; the Apoſtle tells you it was a
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:46240:71"/> School-maſter till Chriſt come, And if you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that in the time of the Law, the Jews time, Chriſt was made known in that diſpenſation, only there was a Vail over the Hearts of the Jews, and they did not ſee ſo clearly, and there was an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Sign of it too amongſt them, for in their Worſhip and Solemn Aſſemblies, they had an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Vail to caſt over them, but there is an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Vail too, which comes over the Hearts of People, that Ecclipſeth the Glory of Chriſt, and the excellency of Chriſt, and till that is <hi>Rent and done away</hi> by an Almighty Power, (for there is nothing outward can do it) when this comes to be taken off Peoples Hearts, then they can ſee Chriſt as he is.</p>
               <p>And what if I ſhould ſay, comparatively, there is a Vail over the Hearts of many that are called Chriſtians, that hinders them from ſeeing the Beauty and Excellency of Chriſt, they do not know the Power of Chriſt, nor the Government of his Spirit in their Hearts, for People may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs Chriſtianity as long as they will, if they do not know Chriſt to Govern them, they are not true Chriſtians; For one of the Prophets among the Jews could Prophecy and Fore-tell of him; Let us conſider it, and find out a right and true Interpretation of it, and apply it unto our own Souls. Iſa. 9. 6. <hi>For unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given, and the Government ſhall be upon his Shoulder, and his Name ſhall be called Wonderful, Conſellor, The Mighty God, The Everlaſting Father, The Prince of Peace, Of the Increaſe of his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Peace there ſhall be no end, The Government ſhall be upon his Shoulder.</hi> All theſe Appellations and Titles are aſcribed to Chriſt Jeſus, he hath the
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:46240:72"/> Government upon him, to Lead and Guide them in the way wherein they ſhould go; Government is an extenſive Word, It imports Government and <hi>Authority, and Rule;</hi> This is applicable to Chriſt, and teacheth that Dignity that was confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red upon Chriſt, and was really due to him: No Man can parallel it by any expreſſion, there is Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in it, there is Juſtice in it, there is a Right and Equity in it, Chriſt hath right to Reign and Rule for ever; I do not ſpeak of outward Government, but of the Government of Chriſt in the Souls of Men, and here the Devil was the firſt Uſurper, He uſurped Authority in the Hearts of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Men, and Chriſt he was Forſaken and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, People went from him, for Chriſt was in the beginning of the World, the World was made by him, Chriſt's Divinity was from Eternity, He was before <hi>Abraham</hi> was, The World was made by him, and when he was in it the World did not know him; And when he came into the World many were not willing that he ſhould Reign over them, ſaid the Jews, <hi>We will not have this Man to Reign over us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if we ſhould find this among Chriſtians you would think it more wonderful and ſtrange. It is now too common among the Children of men, I pray God ſet home upon all our Hearts, that we may let him Reign whoſe Right it is. <hi>We will not have this Man to Reign over us,</hi> ſay the Jews, Do any Chriſtians ſay ſo? Did you ever know a Chriſtian ſay ſo? This is but Diſcourſe you will be ready to ſay, But let me tell you, where People live in Diſobedience to the Laws of Chriſt, this they do with a Witneſs.</p>

               <p>But ſome may ſay, If we had lived in the Jews time we would not have Crucified the Lord of Glory, and yet they Crucifie Chriſt after the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; For a Man to live in Swearing, Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Pride, Ungodlineſs, this is a Crucifying of Chriſt, and a Rebelling againſt Chriſt, men are not willing that Chriſt ſhould Reign over them.</p>
               <p>So that Religion and Chriſtianity is a plain thing, People might Run and Read it, if they would but conſider it; if People were but weighty and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate in theſe great Affairs, they might come to know under whoſe Government they are. The Apoſtle he deſcribed a People that were under the Power of Satan the Prince of Darkneſs, under Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan the <hi>Prince of the Power of the Air,</hi> that ſome were under his Government, and ſome under the Government of Chriſt and his Spirit; One would think theſe were two Propoſitions ſo Intelligible, that if People did but know and conſider, they would for Intereſt ſake eſcape the evil, and cleave to that which is good.</p>
               <p>Now Friends, I would have you deal Candidly with your own Souls, and ſee which Government you are under, <hi>The Prince of the Power of the Air, that Rules in the Hearts of the Children of Diſobedience,</hi> or the Government of Chriſt; He that is diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to God, to his Spirit, and Light, and Grace, he is under the Government, and the Power of the Prince of Darkneſs; This is fulfilled in the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Meſſiah, and it was the great Iniquity of the Jews, and their great unhappineſs and miſery, that when the Meſſiah came into the World, they would not be governed by him; Do not you think it much more ungrateful, if we that are called Chriſtians will not ſuffer Chriſt to Reign over us;
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:46240:73"/> It is unreaſonable, and unchriſtian, and unequal, therefore that you ſhould all conſider it.</p>
               <p>I would ſpeak a little of the Government of Chriſt, with ſome Evidence and Demonſtration, and in a twofold manner that you might more eaſily diſtinguiſh; There are ſome Chriſtians that expect that Chriſt ſhall come and Reign on the Earth, and then they hope to be under his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and it may be they are not ſo careful to mind the preſent time, and to know his Reign and Government now; There are another ſort of People whom God in his Infinite Mercy hath reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their Conſciences and Convinced them that Chriſt hath a right to Reign now, He had a Right to Reign from the beginning, he always had a Right, never forfeited it, never was deprived of it, He hath a twofold right to Reign over the Sons and Daughters of Men.</p>
               <p>1. The firſt is by the Right of Creation, he Created us, none deny (I hope) that the World was Created by Chriſt, therefore he hath right to Govern in it; This is an undeniable Argument, no man can gainſay it but that there is Right and Juſtice belongs to him to Rule and Govern that which he hath made, therefore it is the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful and unnatural thing for men to oppoſe the Reign and Government of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Chriſt hath a right to reign over the Sons and Daughters of Men on the account of his Purchaſe; He did not only Create them, but he did alſo Purchaſe them at the deareſt rate, with the Price of his own precious Blood, <hi>we were not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed with corruptible things as Silver and Gold, or Houſe, Land, or Earthly Treaſure, but with the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Blood of Chriſt, as of a Lamb without blemiſh,</hi>
                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:46240:73"/> 
                  <hi>and without ſpot; He gave himſelfe to be a Ranſom for Mankind. He taſted Death for every Man.</hi> One would think that every Mouth ſhould be ſtopped; ſo there is a twofold Right that Chriſt our Redeemer hath to Reign over us, yet many will not let him Reign, nor let him Exerciſe his Dominion, What do you think of theſe? What will become of them?</p>
               <p>Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt was in the World, he ſpake a Parable to the Jews, I will repeat it, and I would have you all conſider it, whether the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation may not be made to Chriſtians that Rebel againſt him, <hi>Luke 20 9. &amp;c. A certain man Planted a Vineyard, and let it forth to Husbandmen, and went into a far Country for a long time. And at the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he ſent a Servant to the Husbandmen, that they ſhould give him of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ahe Fruit the Vineyard, but the Husbandmen beat him and ſent him away empty; And again he ſent another Servant, and they beat him alſo and entreated him ſhamefully, and ſent him away empty; and again he ſent the Third, and they wounded him alſo and caſt him out, Then ſaid the Lord of the Vineyard, what ſhall I do? I will ſend my Beloved Son, It may be they will Reverence him when they ſee him, but when the Husbandmen ſaw him, they reaſoned among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſaying, This is the Heir, come let us Kill him, that the Inheritance may be ours, So they caſt him out of the Vineyard and Killed him, What therefore ſhall the Lord of the Vineyard do unto them? He ſhall come and deſtroy theſe Husbandmen and ſhall give the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard to others.</hi> If I ſhould apply this, and bring it over to Chriſtians, how dreadful would it be; the Lord turned the Rebellious Jews out of their Country, and overthrew their City, the City of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and deſtroyed the Temple, and left not one Stone upon another.</p>
               <pb n="152" facs="tcp:46240:74"/>
               <p>Now conſider, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt he hath Planted you a Vineyard, I will give you Scripture for it if you pleaſe, <hi>The Vineyard of the Lord of Hoſts was the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael; I mean the Children of Men, It was not an Outward Vineyard, The Houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was his pleaſant Plant; Now as the Lord looked for fruit from them, ſo he expects fruit from us, The Lord hath ſent his Servants in one Age and in another Age, and how have Chriſtians treated them? they have thrown them into Goals and Priſons, and evil intreated them, and they have boaſted and in effect ſaid, the Inheritance is ours, We have Ordinances, we have theſe Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments, and Gifts, and Graces, we need not ſuch a ſilly ſort of People to come to us, and Preach Chriſt and the Light w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Chriſtians, and come to Chruch, to this Meeting and the other Meeting.</p>
               <p>I do not ſpeak by way of Reflection, but I would do it to open your Underſtandings in the Miſtery of the Kingdom of God and true Religion; The Faithful Servants of the Lord have had hard treatment in this Countrey and other Countries in this preſent Age as well as in former Ages, but that is not all, The Lord of the Vineyard, the Great Almighty God hath ſent his Son among you, Will you reverence him and bring forth fruit to him, What do you ſay? Have you fruit for him? I cannot ſay of a wicked People they have fruit for the Lord, for their fruit is untimely Fruit, their Fruit is Iniquity and Tranſgreſſion, but the fruit that is acceptable to the Lord is Holineſs and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, this is the Fruit that God expects from you. Let me tell you Friends; If you will
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:46240:74"/> not reverence his Son Jeſus Chriſt, you will be as deſolate in the day of Judgment as the <hi>Jews</hi> were; you may poſſibly eſcape the Judgment of God in this World, but not then.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Friends, Countrymen, and Citizens,</hi> be you found bringing forth fruit unto the Lord, and be not joyned to that which is evil, be not govern'd by the power of the Prince of the Air, you know where his Rule is, he would Rule in your hearts if you ſhould give way to him, but <hi>reſiſt the Devil,</hi> and let the Kingdom of Chriſt, and his Holy Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment be ſet up in every one of your Souls, then you will be found bringing <hi>forth fruit unto God,</hi> which will be acceptable to him; in the days of old the Prophet takes notice of it, where he ſaith, <hi>I found Iſrael as Grapes in the Wilderneſs,</hi> I found them ſo in their innocence, in their upright State, in their Primitive Condition, your Fathers were a kind of Firſt-Fruits to me, they were as the firſt ripe Fruits of a Fig-Tree before the times they ſeparated themſelves, and bowed to <hi>Baal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Men and Women in their tender days before they came to act evil with violence, they were in better eſteem with the Lord; they were then plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to him as the firſt Fruits of a Fig-Tree, when they were in their innocence and uprightneſs, and many People have come into this good frame of Mind and Spirit, and yet afterward have gone and ſeparated themſelves from the Lord, from the Power and Spirit of Chriſt; they have gone from it, juſt as many did that were called Chriſtians of old; in the Apoſtles time there were ſome Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians that took this courſe, they were acceptable to the Lord for a time, they did run well for a time, and pray how did they begin? which way
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:46240:75"/> did they go? They began in Obedience and in Subjection to Chriſt and his Spirit, but they ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated themſelves afterward, and the Apoſtle writers to them, (do but conſider it,) <hi>O Fooliſh Galatians who hath bewitched you that you ſhould not obey the truth,</hi> (why what is the matter) <hi>before whoſe eyes Jeſus Chriſt hath been evidently ſet forth,</hi> Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied among you, are ye ſo fooliſh, <hi>having begun in the Spirit, are you now made perfect by the Fleſh?</hi> So I may ſay to many called Chriſtians that live in this Land, and obey not the truth, but live in ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, oh Fooliſh People who hath bewitched you, you begun in the Spirit, and then you looked like Quakers as ſome might upbraid you.</p>
               <p>So that you ſee it was above Sixteen Hundred years ago that the Apoſtles did Preach this truth, Preached the Spirit what have you done? <hi>ye did run well,</hi> when ye were firſt convinced you began in the Spirit, how in the Spirit? the Spirit of Chriſt did rule and govern you, there was a right beginning, there was a right Chriſtian Life, do you now think to be made <hi>perfect by the Fleſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So we have abundance of ſuch Chriſtians in the World that have rejected the Spirit, and it is no part of their Religion to walk in the Spirit, they have given it an hard name, an ill name, they have frighted People out of it. Take heed of the Spirit, that you be not deceived by it, and miſled by it, you pretend to be led by the Spirit, take heed of it ſay they; but this was the Foundation of the Goſpel Preaching, and Miniſtry in the Apoſtles times, they laid this foundation, I believe an hundred inſtances might be produced out of the Holy Scriptures to aſſert this Doctrine; you know our Lord Jeſus Chriſt when he was to go out of
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:46240:75"/> the World, ſaid <hi>I go to prepare a place for you, and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you to my ſelf, and I will pray the Father, and he ſhall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever, even the Spirit of Truth, whom the World cannot receive, I will ſend the Spirit of truth that he may lead you into all truth,</hi> what muſt we reject this Doctrine? muſt this be no Article of the Chriſtian Faith to believe in the Holy Spirit? is this not a great obſtruction and impediment to Religion and Chriſtianity; <hi>Let me tell you, till People come to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and to his Truth and Spirit, it will never be well with Chriſtendom;</hi> This ungrateful uſe of the Children of Men in reſiſting and grieving and ſlighting the Holy Spirit, it hath brought all the Judgments, Miſeries and Calamities that are come upon us.</p>
               <p>Oh how do all manner of Abominations, Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Tranſgreſſions abound in the World? How do they run down like a flood in the midſt of us? There is no returning to the Lord; If the Lord ſhould ſend an Angel from Heaven to ſet a Mark upon the forehead of all them that ſigh and cry and mourn and lament for the abominations and ſins of the People of this Nation that make it deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, how few would be found that are true Mourners for their own Sins, and the Sins of the whole Nation?</p>
               <p>This is the end and reſult of our Miniſtry and Teſtimony among you, to turn People from the evil of their ways, this was the end of Chriſts co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into the World. <hi>For this purpoſe was the Son of God manifeſted, that he might deſtroy the works of the Devil,</hi> and that People might turn from their evil ways, and forſake the Pomps and Vanities of
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:46240:76"/> this Wicked World, and all the ſinful Luſts of the Fleſh.</p>
               <p>This is that which you will find to be owned in the Rubrick of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> ſure it was an excellent Spirit that attended People in thoſe days, when there was an introducing and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into their Church-Society and Congregation, they were very ſtrict in it, if they mean as they ſay, which I heartily wiſh; when they are admitted as Church-Members it is allowed to Infants and and Little Children to be brought into the Church by that they call Baptiſm, or ſprinkling of Water upon their faces when this is adminiſtred to them, becauſe they are Infants they have Sureties to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear and ſpeak for them, and engage for them, and what do they engage? They engage againſt the Devil the great Uſurper, that ſo Chriſt might reign as abſolute, the Sureties promiſe and vow three things in the Child's Name, that it ſhall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the Devil and all his Works, the Pomps and Vanities of this wicked World, and all the ſinful Luſts of the Fleſh, and to keep God's Holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments to their Lives end.</p>
               <p>There is not a Quaker in <hi>England</hi> that can Preach up a Doctrine that ſpeaks more abſolutely againſt the Devil than this; I wiſh that all the Church of <hi>England</hi> and Diſſenters likewiſe, would univerſally engage themſelves in this Work againſt the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil, what brave times ſhould we have then? How would true Religion and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity ſlouriſh among us? but they ſay and do not, Oh my Friends, it is ſorrow to me when I conſider it, I do not ſpeak by way of reflection, but out of pure love to your Souls; Oh that the Lord would perſwade you all to engage in this Holy War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:46240:76"/> the Devil and all his Works, the Pomps and Vanities of this Wicked World; I may ſay it with Lamentation, Wickedneſs, Pride, and Aro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy abounds in this Land, and in other Nations, though the Judgments of God have been threatned and his Mercies alſo diſplayed, yet neither the one nor the other have awakened us nor allured us, we do not grow much better, what is this but a ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning us and fitting us for Judgment, and for a day of ſlaughter, when God will pour out all his wrath.</p>
               <p>O Friends, bow your Souls before the Lord God of Heaven, and be humbled under his mighty hand, that ſo you may eſcape the wrath that is to come.</p>
               <p>So my Friends, you ſee the nature of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, as well what was intended of old, as at this day, you have the Teſtimony of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apoſtles and a little hint of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Chriſtians, and of the Reformers of our times, in theſe latter Ages of the World.</p>
               <p>I do not queſtion but among ſuch of elder times, as were called Fathers of the Church, and likewiſe ſuch as <hi>Luther,</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> and thoſe of later days, they were ſincere in their beginnings; what an excellent thing would it be if all Proteſtants would put on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and ſet up his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and let him Reign in their hearts; They will in their Prayers acknowledge <hi>Thine is the Kingdom,</hi> but they will not let him have it, but ſhut him out, <hi>for the Kingdom of God is within</hi> Men; we read in the Goſpel that Chriſt ſhall ſay to ſome at the laſt day, <hi>I know ye not, depart from me ye workers of Iniquity; and they ſhall ſay, Lord, doſt thou not know us? we have eaten and drank in thy preſence and</hi>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:46240:77"/> 
                  <hi>thou haſt taught in our ſtreets, but he ſhall ſay unto them, depart from me, I was a Stranger and you took me not in;</hi> People that live in Rioting and Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs, Swearing and Prophaneſs, and Ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs, they will not let Chriſt into their hearts.</p>
               <p>Friends, I do aſſert the preſent Reign of Chriſt in the Hearts of the Children of Men, what do you think of it? Do you believe it ſhould be ſo? It is ſaid, <hi>Iſa. 9. 7. Of the increaſe of his Government and Peace there ſhall be no end, his Kingdom is an Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Kingdom,</hi> the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> ſpeaks oſ it, <hi>Dan. 7. 9. 27. I beheld till the Thrones were caſt down, and the Ancient of days did ſit, whoſe Garment was white as Snow, and the Hair of his Head like the Pure Wooll, his Throne was like the Fiery Flame, and his Whecls as Burning Fire; a Fiery Stream iſſued and came forth from before him, Thouſand of Thouſands Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred to him, and Ten Thouſand times Ten Thouſand ſtood before him, his Kingdom is an Everlaſting King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and all Dominions ſhall ſerve and obey him; the Meſſiah</hi> ſaith the Prophet, <hi>ſhall finiſh the Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and make an end of Sins, and make reconciliation for Iniquity, and bring in everlaſting Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some People think that the Reign and Government of Chriſt is only in Heaven above, where he <hi>ſits on the Right hand of the Majeſty on high,</hi> but they do not think that he is near the Children of Men; They do not allow his Kingly Office, his Prophetical and his Prieſtly Office: Many cry out againſt the Quakers, that they deny all theſe three Office of Chriſt, what think you of it? I declare to you that Chriſt is a <hi>King that ſhall Reign in Righteouſneſs, and the Iſles ſhall wait for his Law; the Law ſhall go forth from Mount Sitn, and the word</hi>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:46240:77"/> 
                  <hi>of the Lord from Jeruſalem;</hi> ſo that Chriſt is ſpoken of as a King that ſhall Reign and Rule, and his <hi>Kingdom is an Everlaſting Kingdom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As Chriſt is a King to Reign and Rule, ſo he is alſo a Prieſt for ever, not after the Order of <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> but after the Order of <hi>Melchizedeek.</hi> He is a Prieſt, what for? <hi>To finiſh Tranſgreſſion, to make an end of Sin, and purge it away;</hi> Now the Prieſts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, after the order of <hi>Aaron,</hi> they could not do this, they made uſe of Blood, they Sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Sacrifice with Blood, but they could not cleanſe the Souls from Sin, but Chriſt he comes, he is a Prieſt, and he offers a Sacrifice for all, and he offers up himſelf, and by that one Offering he hath for ever perfected them that are ſanctified; he doth it effectually, ſo <hi>Daniel</hi> Prophecied, <hi>he ſhall make an end of Sin, and bring in an everlaſting Righteouſneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O ſay ſome People, we will allow all this to Chriſt when he comes to Reign with his Church, then ſhall his Reign be one, and his Government one; but you ſhould let him be a <hi>King</hi> now, and a a <hi>Prieſt</hi> now, conſider the reaſon of it why it ſhould be now, their is Sin and Iniquity in this World, but there is no Iniquity in the Kingdom of Heaven, <hi>nothing that worketh Abomination, nor ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a Lye</hi> can come there; if Chriſt will purge us from Sin, he muſt come down from Heaven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, and ſo he doth, bleſſed be his Name for ever, he is <hi>the High Prieſt of our Profeſſion,</hi> and he hath made us partakers of the Bleſſing of Clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from Sin. by the purifying vertue of his own precious blood, and the Sanctification of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>
               <pb n="160" facs="tcp:46240:78"/>
               <p>Then conſider in the next place Chriſt is a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet to teach and inſtruct his People in the things that belong to their Everlaſting Peace.</p>
               <p>If there was an Inſpired Prophet in this Land, we ſhould be willing to hear what that Prophet did ſay, if he had good things to tell, and would warn us what evils we ſhould eſcape; Friends, you have a Prophet now, but you do not hear him, this is according to the Teſtimony of <hi>Moſes</hi> of old, <hi>A Prophet,</hi> ſaith <hi>Moſes, ſhall the Lord God raiſe up like unto me, and him ſhall you hear in all things,</hi> Do you hear this Prophet? Who is it? It is the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, hear this great Prophet, what if we do not hear him? <hi>He that heareth him not ſhall be cut off from among the People;</hi> the Apoſtle when he writes to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> he aſſerts the Divinity of Chriſt, and his Prieſtly Office, and we do own and aſſert the Divinity of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt alſo.</p>
               <p>Now to make the Application of this to your Souls, Let Chriſt be your High-Prieſt, Prophet, and King, your Law-giver, Counſellor, and Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that he may bring you to Glory, to a bleſſed ſtate of Salvation, and Eternal Life; and ſo to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt I do recommend you, and leave you; you may find much of this fulfilled in you as you give up your ſelves to the Teaching of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, and of the grace of God, for if Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple will not be thus taught they will never learn Chriſtianity; ſo that People muſt come to Chriſt the great Prophet to learn of him, and be taught by him, elſe they can never be good Chriſtians, Do not you read this Prophecy concerning God's People, <hi>They ſhall be all taught of God,</hi> (and the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> tells us <hi>the Grace of God</hi> (the favour of God through Jeſus Chriſt) <hi>hath appeared to all</hi>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:46240:78"/> 
                  <hi>Men, teaching us that denying ungodlineſs and Worldly Luſt, we ſhould live ſoberly, Righteouſly, and Godly in this preſent World, looking for that bleſſed hope and the glorious appearing of the great God, and our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Jeſus Chriſt, who gave himſelf for us, that he might Redeem us from all Iniquity, and purifie unto himſelf a peculiar People, zealous of all good works.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that my Friends, this is an excellent State and Condition, the Lord bring you all into it, and bring you to a certain and ſaving knowledge of Chriſt, this is my deſire this day, that you may be Chriſtians indeed, and be Followers of Chriſt, and obedient unto him, <hi>who is the Author of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Salvation to all them that obey him.</hi>

               <p>THE end of our Preaching to you the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of the Light within is, that you might come to the Knowledge of Chriſt as he doth appear nigh to you, he is come nigh to the Children of Men in our Age, that is, by his Light, Grace, Spirit, and Truth, whereby he doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the hearts of Men and Women; Thus our Preaching of him doth agree with his own Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, <hi>I am the Light of the World,</hi> and he doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort all that they ſhould ſo believe in him; <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in the Light</hi> ſays he, <hi>that you may be the Children of the Light:</hi> What is a Child of Light? He is ſuch a one as by the Operation of the Power of Chriſt hath know a being <hi>turned,</hi> tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from what? <hi>From Darkneſs unto Light, and from the Power of Satan unto the Power of the living</hi>
                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:46240:81"/> 
                  <hi>God.</hi> And for this we do labour, according to our ability, which the Lord is pleaſed to give to us, that People may be turned from darkneſs unto light, and the following words are Explanatory, <hi>from the Power of Satan unto the Power of the Living God;</hi> ſo that it doth appear, People have been under the Power of Satan, the Evil One that is called <hi>the Prince of the Power of the Air,</hi> he hath a Rule and a Government, but in whom? <hi>In the Children of Diſobedience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the Labour of thoſe Miniſters that were in the days of old, who were the Preachers of the Goſpel, and <hi>Glad Tidings of the Kingdom,</hi> they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch Miniſters as were of Chriſt's own making, their Labour was to turn People from Darkneſs to Light, and from the Power of Satan, to the Power of the Living God, that they might be turned from that evil Power and Spirit that Rules and Works in the Hearts of the Children of Diſobedience, who Rebel againſt the Light that ſhines in their Hearts and Conſciences; For <hi>the Man of Sin</hi> and Worker of Iniquity hath ſuch a power, and we all have been in Captivity to him, we have all been in Captivity to him, we have all been in Bondage to Sin and Satan, which God knew, and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle takes notice of it, ſaith he, <hi>God hath concluded all under Sin,</hi> we have all been under the Power of the Wicked one; For what end hath God conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded all under Sin? For what end is it? that we might be deſtroyed? No, God through Chriſt the Dear Son of his Love, hath extended to you the day of Viſitation, that you might come to the knowledge of Life and Salvation: But wherein may we come to this knowledge? it is in that way which God hath ordained, even by Chriſt,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:46240:82"/> who is the Way to God, Chriſt Jeſus the Eternal Son of God, he is the Bleſſed Mediator and Way to God again. What is Gods end in concluding all under Sin? was it that he might deſtroy all the Children of Men, that are the Workmanſhip of his Hands, that he hath endued with Rational and Immortal Souls? Was it that they might be deſtroyed? No, but that he might have mercy upon all, Gods end in firſt Making and Creating of us was, that we might Live to his Honour; and that we might ſo live in this World, that when we die, we might obtain a Life that ſhall never die, and attain to the poſſeſſion of the <hi>Inheritance amongſt the Saints in Light,</hi> which Chriſt by his precious Blood hath purchaſed for all them that Love him, and give up themſelves to be Followers of him.</p>
               <p>Now my Friends, the Mercy of God appears ſo great to all in and through Chriſt Jeſus, who is the Light of the World, and who is the only Way, and (as my Friend obſerved that ſpake before me) we have not another way, nor is there <hi>any other Name under Heaven, by which we can be ſaved, and obtain Eternal Life,</hi> the Apoſtle refers this to the Name and Power of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; Well if ſo be that it is only by the Power of Chriſt that we muſt know Salvation, where is it that we muſt attain it? How ſhall we do to be made partakers of it, and be ſaved from thee Wrath of God which ſhall come-upon the Workers of Iniquity; For it's ſaid <hi>the Wicked ſhall be turned into Hell, and all the Nations that forget God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>People hope to eſcape the Wrath to come, and Everlaſting Miſery <hi>by Chriſt</hi> whilſt they neglect to improve the preſent time that is afforded to them to obtain Salvation, Chriſt he is come to Redeem
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:46240:82"/> us, that we may know Redemption by him, from what? From Sin, for Pollution and Defilement by ſin is the cauſe why People notwithſtanding all their Names and Profeſſion of Religion ſtill lie under a ſecret condemnation in their own Hearts; If a man ſhould hold ſuch a fair Profeſſion that none could charge him, none condemn him, yet if he meet with ſecret condemnation, through all ſhould ſpeak well of him, if his own Conſcience condemn him, He would not have any true peace or ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in his own mind, for the Teſtimony of a good Conſcience is more to him than all the favour and friendſhip of the World. The light of Chriſt if you incline your minds to obey it, what will be the effect of it? This Light or Spirit of Grace and Truth, which is all one, is ſufficient to Save and Deliver you out of the Temptations and Snares of the Wicked one, for we may every day while we are here, meet with Trials and Temptations of one kind or other; What ſhall a man do that he may be preſerved from the evil of the World, there are many Provocations and evils that a man meets with in the World, How ſhall he do to be preſerved from them? Chriſt hath made Proviſion for us in his Prayer, <hi>(John</hi> 17. 15.) to his Father, <hi>I Pray not that thou ſhouldſt take them out of the World, but that thou ſhouldſt keep them from the evil.</hi> Chriſt will preſerve me from the evil of the World when a Temptationis preſented before me, I ſhall overcome it if I obey the Light of Chriſt which will ſhine upon me, and ſhew me that this muſt be done, and that I muſt leave the other undone: In my own Conſcience there is ſomething will tell me this thing is evil, and I ought not to do it when this Power of Chriſt comes to be cloſe with; For
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:46240:83"/> it is an appearance of Love, Grace, and Mercy, but if I do oppoſe and withſtand this Grace and Mercy, I may miſs of that Power and Strength, which is ſufficient to overcome, and ſo be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by the Temptation. The Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> tells us. <hi>As many as received him, to them gave he Power to become the Sons of God: even to them that believe in his Name.</hi> So, that its they that do Receive Chriſt and Love his Light and Spirit, ſo as to be led by it, that come to know this Power of Chriſt, and thereby an overcoming; But if People ſlight and reject the Grace and Mercy tendered to them, hereupon comes that Sentence pronounced by the Prophet, <hi>Thy Deſtruction is of thy Self;</hi> A man may deſtroy his own Soul by giving way to that which is evil, and rejecting that which is good.</p>
               <p>Therefore My Friends, Cloſe with that Power which inclines you to that which is good, if I mind it, and make trial of it, I ſhall find that within me which will incline me to that which is good; Though I may find ſometimes a corrupt inclination in me to that which is evil, yet there is ſomething alſo that will incline me to do what is required of me; why ſhould I reject that which is good? <hi>Try all things, and hold faſt that which is good;</hi> I have tried many things, but none will do me ſo much good as the Grace and Mercy, Light and appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Chriſt to me if I mind it and cloſe with it; <hi>He hath ſhewed thee O Man what is good,</hi> (ſaith the Prophet <hi>Micah) and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do juſtly, and love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God;</hi> The Lord hath ſhewed you what is his Will, be ye doers of it, ſay then to thy ſelf, ſhall I give way to that which tends to
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:46240:83"/> my own Ruine, <hi>How can I do this wickedneſs and ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God?</hi> Shall I join with the Enemy of my Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and yield to his Temptations, and Diſhonour God, and Ruine my Immortal Soul? God forbid; What you know to be contrary to the Will of God, take heed of it, <hi>Ceaſe to do Evil, Learn to do well; Be followers of that which is good,</hi> take up the Croſs of Chriſt, Deny your Selves and your own Will, know a being <hi>Crucified to the World by the Croſs of Chriſt, and the World Crucified to you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus as I ſaid before, This is the end of our Preaching to you that noble Principle of the Light within, that you might come to the Knowledg of Chriſt, as he doth appear nigh to you, and will lead you <hi>by his Spirit into all Truth,</hi> and incline you to that which is good, and preſerve you from that which is evil, when you are tempted to it; Why ſhould I join with the Devil that dark Spirit, that would draw me to that which will deſtroy my own Soul; The Lord Chriſt he is come to turn me from Sin, and ſave my Soul; Why ſhould I not cloſe with him? He hath ſtood knocking at the Door of my Heart, <hi>till his Head is filled with Dew, and his Locks with the Drops of the Night.</hi> Many Souls have known theſe Wooings and Intreaties of Chriſt, knocking at the Door of their Hearts, and have let him In, and cloſed with his appearance, by his Light, grace and good Spirit, and found the benefit and comfort of it; Why ſhould not I do ſo? Why ſhould not I eſteem him as the chief of Ten Thouſand, as the Beloved of my Soul? He will be the chiefeſt of all to that Soul that hath choſen him for the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Good; Though there may be ſome comfort in the enjoyment of the things of this World, yet though they be uſeful and neceſſary for my preſent
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:46240:84"/> ſupply, If I loſe them all, and find Chriſt, and be found in him, and hold him faſt, I ſhall count them as nothing, but deſpiſe them in compariſon of him who is the Beloved of my Soul.</p>
               <p>You that are come to the Knowledge of Chriſt, and have embraced the Light of Truth in your own Hearts, do know the benefit you have by it, in walking in the Light, as the Children of Light, and of the Day, and in Obedience to Chriſt who is the Light, and ſhines in your Hearts.</p>
               <p>Friends I would not be miſtaken, I do not Preach Chriſt as the Light of the World, in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to his outward appearance, and being mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in the Fleſh in that preapared Body wherein he did his Fathers will when he was on Earth; All true Chriſtians do eſteem and reverence Chriſts appearance in the Body, wherein he ſuffered death, and <hi>became a Sacrifice for our Sins,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Eph. 5. 2. Chriſt hath loved us, and hath given himſelf for us, an Offering and a Sacrifice to God for a ſweet ſmelling Savour;</hi> If I eſteem the Appearance of Chriſt in my own Heart, I ſhall be ſo far from having a light eſteem of his Bodily Appearance, and his being manifeſt in the Fleſh, that I ſhall admire and reverence that <hi>Great Myſtery of Godlineſs,</hi> and bleſs God for the record given thereof in the Holy Scriptures, which the light of Chriſt is a Key to open, <hi>Even the Great Myſteries of the Kingdom,</hi> which men by their parts and acquire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments cannot attain to; For God hath not made known theſe great things to the Wiſe and Prudent, as we may gather from Chriſts own Prayer, <hi>Mat. 11. 25. I thank thee O Father, Lord of Heaven and Earth, becauſe thou haſt hid theſe things from the Wiſe</hi>
                  <pb n="173" facs="tcp:46240:84"/> 
                  <hi>and Prudent, and haſt revealed them unto Babes; Even ſo Father, for ſo it ſeemed good in thy ſight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My Friends, walk in the Light more and more, that by the Spirit of the Lord, you may be acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the divine operation of the Power of Chriſt, which will bring you from under the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of Sin and Corruption into the glorious li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the children of God, wait to know this Power in your own Hearts, <hi>that you may be ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied throughout in Spirit, Soul and Body, and Juſtified freely by his Grace, through the Redemption that is in Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 3. 24. Walk in the Light, and in Meekneſs and Humility, and in the Truth, <hi>1 John 6. 7. If we ſay we have fellowſhip with him and walk in darkneſs, we Lie, and do not the Truth, But if we walk in the Light as he is in the Light, we have Fellowſhip one with another, and the Blood of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt his Son, cleanſeth us from all Sin.</hi> Many of you have <hi>known the beginning,</hi> go forward, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to walk in the Truth, that you may know the Blood of Cleanſing, that as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom. 6. 22. But now being made free from Sin, and become Servants to God, ye may have your Fruit unto Holineſs, and the end Everlaſting Life.</hi>

               <head>A SERMON Preached by Mr. JOHN VAUGHTON. At <hi>Grace-Church ſtreet, April, 1ſt.</hi> 1694.</head>
               <p>IT is a great mercy and kindneſs, that God hath been pleaſed to open the way of Life and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation unto the Souls of many People that in this our Day and generation were in great diſtreſs, for want of the knowledge of it, and this knowledge is given unto us through the bleſſed ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, and Revelation of the Power and Spirit of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, to which my Friends, Bleſſed be the Name of the Lord we have been turned in our Day and Generation.</p>
               <p>For the Meſſage and Teſtimony that God raiſed up his Servants to bear among us in our Day, and time, who came in the Spirit and Power of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, having been made the Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:46240:87"/> of Gods mercy through Faith in him, <hi>that died for our Sins, and roſe again for our Juſtification,</hi> That Bleſſed meſſage and Teſtimony which they bare among us, <hi>was in the Evidence and Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirit and Power</hi> of the Lord Jeſus; For they came indeed to Preach the Goſpel of Life and Salvation, and the way they took to Preach the Goſpel to us in our Day, was the ſame way that the Holy Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in his Day was ſent, to Preach the Goſpel, who ſaid we are ſent of God, <hi>To turn People from Darkneſs unto Light, and from the power of Satan unto God;</hi> The Holy Apoſtle he propoſed the end for which they were ſent to turn the Sons and Daughters of Men, <hi>from Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to Light, and from the Power of Satan, to the Power of God, that they might receive remiſſion of Sins, and an Inheritance among them which are Sanctified through Faith which is in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O Friends, This Faith in Chriſt, it is a living Faith, it is a <hi>Faith of the operation of God;</hi> God worketh it in us by his own Spirit and Power: there are many that pretend to have Faith in Chriſt that are ſtrangers to the operation of the Power and Spirit of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, and ſo do not know nor are made partakers of that <hi>Faith, which worketh by Love, that giveth them Victory over the World,</hi> and preſerveth them and keepeth them out of the Evil of the World.</p>
               <p>Now Friends, it is my deſire that you may <hi>turn from Darkneſs unto Ligh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="180" facs="tcp:46240:88"/> and Teſtimonies of all the Faithful Meſſengers, and Servants whom the Lord hath raiſed up in this our Day, and ſent <hi>to turn Men from Darkneſs unto Light, and from the Power of Satan to the power of God,</hi> that their Labour and Travel (I ſay) may not be in Vain, that we may all come to <hi>believe in the Light, that we may be Children of the Light and of the Day,</hi> that ſo we may come to walk in the Light; And then my Friends we ſhall all come to be brought into an Heavenly Fellowſhip; <hi>If we walk in the Light as he is in the Light, we have Fellowſhip one with another, and the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt the Dear Son of God, cleanſeth us from all Sins.</hi> And this is a Work that will be profitable for all to know, ſeeing <hi>no unclean thing ſhall ever enter into the Kingdom of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Friends, Our Juſtification, that is indeed in and through, and by the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, for his ſake not our own; Any thing that we have done or can do, will not have a tendency to make our Peace with God, ſeeing that <hi>we can do nothing our ſelves that is aceeptable and well pleaſing to God;</hi> Therefore we cannot in the leaſt (as hath been unjuſtly charged upon us) diſeteem or put a light eſteem on what the Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath done for us, in his own Perſon without us, nor upon what by his own Power and Spirit he hath wrought in our Hearts; But we believe in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, both as to his outward Appearance as he was, <hi>God manifeſt in the Fleſh,</hi> and alſo in his Inward and Spiritual Appearance in our Souls; We believe in him that hath appeared by his Light and Grace, and Truth in our Hearts, and we know <hi>the Effectual Working and Operation of his Divine Power, to Sanctifie and Cleanſe, and Purifie our Souls;</hi> And
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:46240:88"/> thereby we come to have a real ſenſe of the benefit and Advantage that the Souls of the Children of Men have in and by Death, and Sufferings, Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and Aſcenſion of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Till People come to believe in his Spiritual Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance by his Light and Grace, and truth in their Hearts, and to receive him and entertain him, and let him have a place in their Souls, that he by his Power may purge away Sin and Tranſgreſſion; While Men remain Rebellious and ſtubborn, and will not let him in, <hi>when he ſtands and knocks at the Door of their Hearts,</hi> that he may come in and ſup with them, and they with him; When Men Rebel againſt his Heavenly light within them, and turn away from his Divine Grace and Holy Spirit, and <hi>turn the Grace of God into Wantoneſs, Laſciviouſneſs,</hi> and run into Uncleaneſs, Drunkenneſs, Pride, Envy, Malice, and bitterneſs, and into thoſe things that are abominable and Evil in the ſight of the Lord, Theſe men have no real Advantage, or bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Death and Sufferings of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the <hi>Satisfaction and Attonement he hath made for our Sins, by that one Offering, and Sacrifice of himſelf;</hi> and they do not truly know the bleſſed end and deſign of his Appearance and coming into the World; <hi>For this purpoſe was the Son of God manifeſted that be might deſtroy the Works of the Devil, that he might finiſh Transgreſſion and make an end of Sin, and bring in Everlaſting Righteouſneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My Friends, the end of the Working of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible Power and Spirit of Chriſt is, that he may have a place in all your Hearts, and that you may entertain him; For the Lord will draw a Line of Judgment upon all that go under a Profeſſion of
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:46240:89"/> Chriſtianity, and own what the Lord Jeſus Chriſt did without them, but will not receive him, en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tertain him, and believe in him, as he doth ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tually Appear and ſhine in into their Hearts by hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>My Friends, Remember the ſore Judgments Miſeries, Calamities and diſtreſs that came upon the <hi>Jews,</hi> becauſe of their rejecting Chriſt in his outward Appearance, in that prepared Body in which he came to do his Fathers will; They would not own him in his Bodily Appearance, but rejected him, <hi>and ſet him at nought, they Crowned him with Thorns, and Crucified the Lord of Life and Glory; He ſaid unto them except ye believe that I am he, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> Deſolate for I ſay unto you, ye ſhall not ſee me henceforth till ye ſhall ſay, Bleſſed is he that cometh in the Name of the Lord.</hi> He tells them of the Calamity, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs that ſhould come upon them and overtake them, and ſo it came paſs, becauſe they rejected the Love of God, which in Chriſt Jeſus was extended to them, when he would have gathered them and brought them into a ſtate of Reconciliation and peace with the Living God but they would not.</p>
               <p>So now my Friends, In this day of Chriſts In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and Spiritual Appearance, you have had the Teſtimonies of thoſe that have been ſent to you in the Name and Power, and Spirit of the Living God, and yet many will not believe in the Lord
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:46240:89"/> Jeſus Chriſt, nor receive him Inwardly and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually appearing in their Hearts, nor give way to him, nor wait, and attend upon him, to do that work in them, and for them which they cannot do for themſelves; What work is that? The Work of Sanctification. For none come to be <hi>Juſtified freely by the Grace of God through the Redemption that is in Jeſus Chriſt, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks,</hi> Rom. 3. 24. <hi>but they are alſo Sanctified by the Spirit of Chriſt, and made partakers of the Divine Nature;</hi> So that is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary for us to know Chriſts Power and Spirit, to renew and ſanctifie our Souls, and purifie and cleanſe us.</p>
               <p>When we come to believe in the Inward and Spiritual Appearance of Chriſt, and to know the Work of Sanctification, we cannot have a ſlight e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem of, nor diſ-believe or undervalue what the Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath done with us, in his Perſon; For we ſhall come to find the Benefit, Gain, Advantage, and profit of it redounding to our Souls, <hi>through that one offering, when he offered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf through the Eternal Spirit as a Lamb without ſpot;</hi> He offered himfelf once for all, and we have the benefit of it, when we come to receive him, live in Obedience to him, and Anſwer his requirings, and walk in the Spirit, And then as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>If we walk in the Spirit, we ſhall not fulfil the Luſts of the Fleſh, for all that is in the World, the Luſt of the Fleſh, the Luſt of the Eyes, and the Pride of Life, is not of the Father, but is of the World, and the World paſſeth away, and the Luſt thereof, but he that doth the Will of God abideth for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore ſee to it, you that make a profeſſion of it. ſee that as you have received the Lord Jeſus
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:46240:90"/> Chriſt you walk as he walked, that you live in the Spirit, and walk <hi>in</hi> the Spirit, and not fulfil the Luſts of the Fleſh; that you live not in malice, envy, or bitterneſs, and ſo grieve the good Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, and bring a burthen upon the Souls of the Righteous.</p>
               <p>We that are come to the ſight and viſion of Heavenly things, and have <hi>the Myſteries of the Kingdom of God</hi> opened to us, we are come to be Partakers of the gift of Charity which is <hi>a more excellent way,</hi> if this be wanting, all is wanting; what doth the Apoſtle ſay, <hi>though I ſpeak with the Tongue of Men and of Angels, and have not Charity, I am become as ſounding-Braſs, or a Tinkling Cymbal, and though I have the gift of Prophecy, and underſtand all myſteries and all knowledge, and though I have al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Theſe things have been often ſaid and declared to you, Friends, and I have now this General Teſtimony to give in the dread and fear of the Lord God, They that <hi>love God above all,</hi> will <hi>Love</hi> their <hi>Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as themſelves,</hi> they will love thoſe that are the Friends of God, and of his People; nay it is a duty incumbent on them, <hi>A New Commandment</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>I give unto you that ye love one another as I have lovtd you that ye alſo love one another. By this ſhall all Men know that ye are my Diſciples if ye have love one to another;</hi> And we are not only to love one another, but to love our Enemies, this our Lord Jeſus Chriſt commandeth us, <hi>Mat. 5. 44. But I ſay unto you, love your Enemies, bleſs them that</hi>

                  <hi>curſe you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them that deſpitefully uſe you and perſecute you, that ye may be the Children of your Father which is in Heaven, for he cauſeth his Sun to ſhine on the evil, and on the good, and ſendeth Rain on the juſt, and on the unjuſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, my Friends, that you may keep in this love of God, and love to one another, it is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and breathing of my Soul, That ſo <hi>your Faith may ſtand not in the wiſdom of Mens words. but in the</hi> power of God; this power will <hi>bring down every high thought and imagination into ſubjection and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to Chriſt, that we may walk before bim to all well pleaſing,</hi> that when we come to die we may lay down our heads in peace, and <hi>be found of him in peace without ſpot, and blameleſs, and</hi> at the end of our days we <hi>may receive the end of our Faith, the Salvation of our Immortal Souls.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Friends, to the Grace of God I commend you, the Lord God of life preſerve and keep you, that you may be ſafe in the hands of God, and <hi>abide un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſhadow of his wing,</hi> and be ſurrounded with his Almighty Arm, which hath hitherto preſerved us in all our Solemn Meetings and Aſſemblies, when the Enemies of Gods truth have riſen up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us; The remembrance of it ſhould be ſweet and pleaſant to us, <hi>When the floods of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodly</hi> were muſtred up againſt us, and ſometimes halled us out of our Meetings to Goals and Priſons for bearing Teſtimony to the Truth of God in our day, O the ſweet and comfortable preſence of the Lord that then attended us, and bleſſed be his Name <hi>he waited to be gracious to us,</hi> and did work manifold Deliverances for us; and Praiſe and Glory be given

               <p>And, Friends, it greatly concerns us to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the whole courſe of our Lives, that we may not give any occaſion for the obſtructing or hazard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the preſent Peace and Liberty we enjoy; O there ſhould be a ſerious care and tender regard to Gods Glory, and the Honour of his Great and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Name, and alſo a care and concern for the Reputation of our Religion, and Religious Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that none may have any occaſion or juſt ground to beſpatter and reproach us, and render us odious to the Government under which we live.</p>

               <head>A SERMON Preached by Mr. FRANCIS STAMPER, At <hi>Devonſhire-Houſe, May</hi> 3. 1694. God hath laid help upon one that is Mighty, to ſeve to the uttermoſt all that come unto God by him.</head>
               <p>THis Mighty One, that the Almighty Lord <hi>Jehovah</hi> hath laid help upon for Man, it is the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Son of his Love, and they are bleſſed of God that come to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the help that is in him, who ſaid to his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples and Followers in the days paſt, <hi>without me ye can do nothing.</hi>

               <p>Friends, This is a deep and a very near word, and it ſtands us all upon to conſider whether we have him or no, for we all owe Service, a Duty and a Worſhip to the Everlaſting God, and of our ſelves we cannot perform it, without the help and
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:46240:98"/> aſſiſtance of his Beloved Son the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and the comfort of all that believe in him and love him is this, that he is not only able to help, but willing to help.</p>
               <p>Bleſſed be the Lord God for ever, may all you ſay that have been made partakers of his Vertue, and of his Power and Life, that have found a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs in him to aſſiſt you in all your troubles, in all your exerciſes, in all your afflictions. in all the bowings of your Souls and Spirits before the Lord, who have ſaid in your Prayers and Supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Lord, lend me thy help, let me have thy gracious aid and aſſiſtance; Without this help of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt we cannot do that good that ſometimes we deſire, but we are even like to poor <hi>Iſrael</hi> when they had forgotten the Lord, when they had been cleaving to that that led them in the ſteps the end whereof was deſtruction. The Lord thus complained by his Prophet; <hi>O Iſrael thou haſt deſtroyed thy ſelf, but thy help is in me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And, O Friends, what greater love could the Lord God have ſhewn to the loſt Sons of <hi>Adam</hi> then to have ſent his Son, his only begotten Son from the boſom of his Heavenly Love to Redeem Man up to God again, to reſtore Man again, and bring him back again out of that alienated ſtate, and out of that undone condition that he was fallen into by his diſobedience and tranſgreſſion againſt the Lord; God <hi>hath hath laid help upon one that is Mighty, Mighty to ſave.</hi>

               <p>Is there any poor Soul here this day that wants the Salvation of God, that wants to be ſaved from Sin, that ſo it may be ſaved from Hell, ſaved from woe, ſaved from diſtreſs, ſaved from miſery,

               <p>This one Shepherd is preſent here, my Friends, pray here his voice this Afternoon, his voice is ſweet and lovely, and pierceth the very heart, it calls upon you, <hi>Open to me my well-beloved;</hi> It calls you out of ſin, and out of iniquity, and out of that which offends the Lord; O Friends, this Voice calls, <hi>open to me my Beloved,</hi> you that are turned from this World, from the love of Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Pleaſures, from thoſe vain delights that periſh in the uſing, and the deſire of your hearts is
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:46240:99"/> that you may be more acquainted with him that is the good Shepherd of your Souls, that ſaith <hi>I call mine own Sheep by Name,</hi> bleſſed be you that have this new Name; <hi>I go before them and they follow me, and I will give to them Eternal Life,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, what greater gift can you have? what better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward can you have? you that have the help of the Lord, you that have the ſtrength of the Almighty, you that have your dependance upon him, you that can truly ſay the Lord hath laid help upon one that is mighty, I feel his Mighty Arm, and his Mighty Power that hath helped me, and overcome great things that I thought I could never over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come; Open the door of thy heart ſaith Chriſt, and I will overcome that by which thou haſt been over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come; All praiſe glory and thankſgiving be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned through Chriſt to the Living God and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all.</p>
               <p>O My Friends, feel your Minds gathered into a ſenſe of Gods love, into a pure exerciſe of his Heavenly life and love, that in this we may go on and travel together, that in this we may be exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed together for the Glory of God, and the good and peace and welfare of one another.</p>
               <p>Friends, God's care is over his People, his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence is daily extended towards them in a plentiful and wonderful manner; There is one promiſe of the Lord that comes into the view of my Mind, even that promiſe made to them in ancient times, <hi>My People ſhall dwell in a ſure dwelling, and ſhall reſt in a quiet habitation;</hi> Let us pray that every one of us may be in the number of God's People that have a ſure dwelling; for, my Friends, great diſappointments, great exerciſes and trouble will overtake the Habitations of the Wicked, that
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:46240:100"/> are hard hearted and forgetters of God; Let us keep humble and tender and reverent in the ſight of the God of Heaven; all our ſtrength will fail us, and all our own wiſdom if we do not keep faithful to him that God hath laid help upon; What are we poor Worms in Compariſon of the Almighty, <hi>he can do in Heaven and Earth whatſoever he pleaſeth;</hi> Man is to be wrought upon according to his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine will and pleaſure; we are to ſubmit to him, and to be reſigned and given up to the Lord God of Heaven and Earth, and to lie low before him, and to come to that in practice which People have been ſpeaking of in words.</p>
               <p>It is part of that Prayer that our Bleſſed Lord taught his Followers and Diſciples, wherein he ſaid <hi>thy will be done in Earth as it is in Heaven;</hi> There is no Man or Woman can really come to Chriſt but thoſe that have their Wills ſubmitted to the will of God, <hi>this is the will of God your ſanctification,</hi> it is the will of God that we ſhould all be ſanctified, that we ſhould be holy and pure, then the bleſſing of the God of Heaven will be upon us.</p>
               <p>Among the many bleſſings that Chriſt uttered on the Mountain, one was this, <hi>Bleſſed are the pure is heart for they ſhall ſee God;</hi> it doth beſpeak this, that the ſight of God ſhall be very clear, to thoſe that are pure in heart, that come to have their hearts and minds ſubjected to the will of God, <hi>for he worketh in them both to will and to do according to his good pleaſure;</hi> O then they ſhall know the vertue of this purity of heart, they ſhall ſee God, O how precious a thing is it to have that purity that can behold the Lord, no confeſſion of acknowledgment will be ſufficient.</p>
               <pb n="205" facs="tcp:46240:100"/>
               <p>Thus it was when <hi>Nicodemus a Phariſee,</hi> and a a Ruler of the <hi>Jews</hi> came to Jeſus by night, he ſaid unto him <hi>Rabbi, we know that thou art a Teacher come from God, for no Man can do theſe Miracles that thou doſt except God be with him;</hi> here was a large Confeſſion that Chriſt was the Teacher of the way of God aright, yet that would not ſerve, for <hi>Jeſus anſwered and ſaid unto him, except a Man be born a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain he cannot ſee the Kingdom of God,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Friends, It is a near word that ſhould come home to us, and Convince us of this truth of God, that we fall ſhort not of this Regeneration, and of having our hearts and ſpirits renewed by the God of Heaven, <hi>except we be born again we cannot ſee the Kingdom of God;</hi> This New Birth is that by which the Bleſſings of the God of Heaven are conveyed to the Soul, and that through the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; <hi>God hath ſent his Son to bleſs us in turning every one of us from our Iniquities, and from the evil of our ways,</hi> from our Sin and Vanity, from our Corruption and Wickedneſs to the pure everlaſting God; They know it to be thus that come to fear God, and be partakers of that, Wiſdom that leads to Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs <hi>Prov. 8. 20. I Wiſdom lead in the way of Righteouſneſs in the midſt of the Paths of Judgment, that I may cauſe thoſe that love me to inherit ſubſtance, and I will fill their Treaſures;</hi> Can the Treaſure of any heart be better filled?</p>
               <p>O That theſe words of Wiſdom might take im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion upon every one of your hearts, that you might feel the love of the Mighty God ſhed abroad upon your hearts by the Holy Ghoſt, that your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and breathings <hi>may aſcend like Incenſe, and be a ſweet ſmelling Sacrifice to the Lord this evening;</hi> O that every one was ſo qualified as to Worſhip the
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:46240:101"/> Living God aright, that in the concluſion of this Meeting every ones heart may burn within them, and may come with tender breathings and inflamed affections unto Gods Altar, and find acceptance.</p>
               <p>My Friends, the goodneſs of the Lord hath been very great towards you, and his Long ſuffering and patience hath been largely extended, <hi>he willeth not the death of a Sinner, but deſires that they ſhould Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, return and live; As I live ſaith the Lord, I delight not in the death of a Sinner, turn you turn you from your evil ways, why will ye die O Houſe of Iſael.</hi> Now if thou ſayſt I would fain turn from the evil of my ways, I would fain have power and ſtrength to do good and overcome evil, then come to him that is mighty, upon whom <hi>God hath laid help, who is able to ſave to the the u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>But, ſay ſome, that is impoſſible, but pray con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, <hi>God hath laid help upon one that is mighty;</hi> and thou mayſt do all things through Chriſt that ſtrengthens thee, By his Divine Power working in thy heart he can effect that work in thee which thou canſt not do in thy own ſtrength, that work which he will accept of, the work of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Holineſs, and Purity, in which State the Bleſſing of the God of Heaven is conveyed to thy Soul, <hi>Bleſſed are the Pure in Heart for they ſhall ſee God</hi> their eyes being opened to look unto him in whom Salvation is; <hi>In vain</hi> do Men look <hi>for Help and Salvation from the Hills, and from</hi> the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains; <hi>Look unto me</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>and be ſaved,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>O here is a good encouragement for you who are wreſtling with the Lord God, to receive a Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from his Divine hand, here is good encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for you to wreſtle; <hi>Jocob</hi> was a Wreſtler <hi>and he Wreſtled with God, and as a Prince he prevailed, and he ſaid, I will not let thee go except thou bleſs me;</hi> Will you be Wreſtlers with the God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for a bleſſing from his Divine hand? Labour to be gathered with a pure mind into the will of God as humble lowly and meek Creatures, ſubmitting your ſelves to him, being ſenſible of your unworthineſs, and that you are <hi>leſs than the leaſt of all his Mercies;</hi> Say, Lord, what am I that thou ſhouldeſt be mindful of me? What I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived thou gaveſt me, I have no breath, no good thing but what thou gaveſt me; I depend on thee for all, and will give thee the praiſe of all that I have, and hope for.</p>
               <p>Thus you muſt labour to keep your ſelves hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, meek, and tender, and in a ſelf-denying frame; that you may be fit to follow the Lord Jeſus who invites ſuch to come to him; <hi>Come unto me all you that labour and are heavy laden and I will give you reſt, Take my Yoke upon you and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, and ye ſhall find reſt unto your Souls, for my Yoke is eaſie, and my Burthen is light; Learn of me</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>for I am meek and lowly:</hi> It is as if he had ſaid, be you ſo too, learn that Leſſon and you ſhall find reſt to your Souls; What more excellent Reward then to have peace with the Eternal God, and not only ſo, but in all our Tryals, Afflictions, and Exerciſes in this Life
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:46240:102"/> to be kept in a quiet and peaceable frame, when the Soul can throw it ſelf upon God, and ſay, Lord I will caſt all my care upon thee, for thou careſt for me.</p>
               <p>My Friends, Look unto the Lord, there will be great need for it; many have been the warnings given to the Inhabitants of this Nation, and of this City, of the dreadful Judgments of God that he will certainly bring upon the wicked and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted, and upon the ſtiffnecked and Rebellious; and I hope that through the Divine workings of the Divine Spirit and Power of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and through his Divine and Heavenly light that hath attended theſe warnings and teſtimonies many will be ſtirred up to Repentance.</p>
               <p>And I have this more to ſay, that the Lord God in the opening of his Divine Word hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded me; This ſay to my People in the City of <hi>London,</hi> and elſewhere, where I have ordered thy Lot; Be of believing hearts, for the Vials of my wrath ſhall be poured out upon the Tranſgreſſors; Therefore charge the Daughters of <hi>Sion</hi> that they touch not with the Daughters of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and tell them that <hi>if they partake with them in their Sins, they ſhall partake with them in their Plagues,</hi> and in the puniſhments that God will pour down and execute upon the workers of Iniquity, and greater will be their Condemnation if they do not repent and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, than of thoſe that have not had ſuch oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities.</p>
               <p>Therefore Children of <hi>Sion</hi> look unto the Lord Jeſus Chriſt that Mighty one, upon whom <hi>help is laid,</hi> in whom is Divine ſtrength and Power, and from whom you may have Divine Aſſiſtance, that we may perform the good that is required at our
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:46240:102"/> hands, and that is incumbent upon us, and that we owe to our Creator, that we may Worſhip him from day to day, and from one time to another; they that perform this ſervice in the ſtrength of Chriſt, they will feel the ſavour of his life upon them and find the ſweetneſs of joy and peace in their Souls; and when we are in our Imployments, and Callings and Buſineſs, we ſhall feel the ſavour of Divine Life going along with us, and in all our Converſe and Communion one with another; and in our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, we ſhall inſtruct and correct, and direct our Children, and bring them up in <hi>the fear of the Lord,</hi> that they may not do as the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> when ſome of their Judges were dead, <hi>every one did that which was right in their own eyes,</hi> Let them do what they will ſaith <hi>Joſhua, chuſe you this day whom you will ſerve, as for me and my Houſe we will ſerve the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O get your wills ſubjected to the will of God, that you may obey his Righteous Law, and feel your ſelves engaged in his ſervice, and have the powerful working of his Holy Spirit in your Souls; God will by his own Almighty Arm and Heavenly Grace enable you to do what he requires, and is pleaſing in his ſight, <hi>he will work in you both to will and to do of his own good pleaſure; By Grace ye are ſaved,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>not of your ſelves, it is the gift of God;</hi> To this Divine Gift we are all recommended, Now the Lord God Almighty gather you all into a ſenſe of it.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle when he wrote to the Churches, he committed them to <hi>the Grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> for Guiding and Governing them in the whole courſe of their Converſations, that they
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:46240:103"/> might live in the pure fear and love of God, and obedience to him, and in Love and Concord one with another, <hi>that God in all things may be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and Praiſe, and Honour, and Thanks givings may be offered up to him, through Jeſus Chriſt his Beloved Son, and our alone Saviour, who alone is worthy,</hi> who is God over all, Bleſſed for ever and ever <hi>Amen.</hi>
